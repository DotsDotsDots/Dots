If the spirits of the dying could stand at my feet
Never seemed like the time for this conversation
So you talk about love, conversation, and money
Very soon will we let the stars start to fade
That deep inside you’ve got lots of trouble
Way down here—there’s a hole in the heart
You’re still on the verge of getting higher
This old art: You’re always so interesting
Did you watch pornstars when you were young?
Jump backwards - I see you’re so beautiful
Make those sounds just a little further away
Didn't you know you were coming all the way?
They know you’re looking through your lens
Those flowers that used to lie on the ground
Holy it’s not holy it's clean’s straight
I’ve spent the last century stranded alone
You're upset, we can just sit here and weep
They're supposed to be like an ordinary day
Restlessness is what keeps men from earning
Hope I'll be around to add some perspective
You can get paid more than I’m asking for
I just want to watch the streetlights shift
Till the soul of his dreams starts to shake
He’s already been awake in another dream
That year the masters of archery were back
Look what you did when you took care of me
But where do you get the government money?
Eyes open and pure and what is there of me
Don’t lose sight of what we all stand on
You’re supposed to be a sorrowful artist
Wouldn't it be funny if he’s loved again
Your lives don’t seem all that different
You look like you, or you don't come close
But all it took was a little fella singing
Young blood's wounds are running like hail
What if it’s broken down and torn apart?
Look at the snake like you’ve never seen
The tension keeps running through my veins
The speed with which time keeps repeating
And what is darkness until the last scene
But, won't you know that I gave you this?
What I once thought to be a beautiful art
Saying he won’t take me if he’s right
Isn't it better for everybody to be safe?
You’ll be making my heart full of nails
The lyrics to all the things I had to say
I can feel you’re close to getting high
We’ll be moving in different directions
The water here, the bones under the paint
Killing all that nobody’s understanding
My mouth is open to those who’re afraid
You say it with that feeling in your eyes
My beheaded title: Findings from eternity
Finally liberty if you get back on stage
Oh my god; I know you and I live by fate
It keeps your hot lips from looking wild
Just to try and keep the honeymoon quiet
And then I was like, What are you doing?
The angels say the world is never to end
A policeman walkin' by at the tender age
First I spent my life pursuing a mystery
The machines won’t seem so complicated
Where they lived the rest of their lives
I think he says it's for your cup of tea
Please, I've got your little boy's money
I’ll not keep my head out of the water
Looking for you’s last minute overture
Been waiting for you I’m not satisfied
Cool; you’re trying your best together
And I know this because I’ve got to it
The action is good, that you can breathe
This is the coolest movie I've ever seen
Tell me she’s telling me her true name
What do we mean by saying we don't care?
I say to myself that we’re all friends
I don’t know who I’m gonna belong to
Concoct one thing and pass it off as art
Looking at you on a dark and rainy night
You’re talking about the immense spark
A message that appears in the blue skies
Money will never go where it needs to go
Please just find me the one in your life
It took me from living out with my mind
But it was the first time we all talked
I don’t understand why you’re dying
I don’t know if you were good or evil
The moonbeam blade on the brown citadel
So we like to become good at what we do
Am I supposed to sound like a nightmare
I don’t need to watch it last forever
When’s a girl with the right or wrong
What’s all those paintings out there?
First of all, let me show you the doors
The holy synagogue of the old testament
They’ve got the time to get locked in
Starlight begins to stream from windows
The sound of these endless train wrecks
I need you’ve built me a secret dream
Was it supposed to be about your lives?
That low wind brings you so much stress
It’s almost time for a Christmas tree
This has nothing to do with crying baby
Your house was built just the other day
But the nails that hang on my own knees
You know I’ve seen the same patterns
Is it okay if it just keeps saying so?
Maybe I'm not quite at the right place
You’ve only been asleep for two days
Then she opens the box and it’s busy
The streams started to drain of colour
An hourglass I’m seen in the airport
Don’t you feel the force of tomorrow
The purists call me an evil lust fiend
Can't you just be as sweet as she says
Anything that makes you want to scream
Stand beside me: Looking into your eye
As soon as my darling dream comes true
Or I’m gonna turn into somebody else
Rather hungry, I’m going to kill you
Say something different than the order
Downstairs watching you face the world
His habit of asking me if I got a look
Always keep my little princess smiling
Do you know where we’ll be tomorrow?
Without getting into this deep silence
I cannot wait to find out what you say
Come, come, come, come into that rush?
Somebody just followed me to your back
They should at least give me the money
Little hands lead me down to the banks
I feel like it’s time to say goodbye
You look like you’d been here before
Lost time watching rain on television
It’s a pretty girl in a dirty hotel
It came out his skin and talked to me
You’re bringing a night in her head
Re-title: When’s that band playing?
One of the finest cities of the world
And said, it wouldn't hurt to be free
The thrill of moving across the water
I’m going to live like nobody knows
Be careful for the kings of emptiness
A brave, jealous, violent blind angel
They took my life, they took my money
As they say, the shortening of memory
One another belongs in all the worlds
Could not find the time to go to work
When she looked at me with blank eyes
Human beings can do nothing but watch
You know what? I can’t be your muse
Down through the eyes of a dying fool
And you’ve never found the security
I grew up watching you’re all right
I’m giving away something to anyone
Your voice is fucking in the distance
To find out how I can trust the world
Something new, something to take away
There are some minutes until tomorrow
You could smell those innocent things
To linger here for another generation
He always looked at me, made me watch
I saw a book’s starting to come out
I say I can put away all that sadness
If you don’t want to take advantage
You’ve spent your life stuck behind
Cut you off and drag your arms around
Jesus invented the birth control pill
The change that has already been felt
Just to see you’ve said this before
Inspiration flying through your veins
Sitting there and looking down on you
Been crying and laughing in your head
I’ll kick your ass a thousand times
No toilet title: Red meat after blood
Yes, this was right around the corner
I’m never going to pick up my shoes
You may as well just go find yourself
She sees every little thing I'm doing
The number of dinosaurs on an island
The sight that comes around the bend
There are times I thought I was gone
These songs give my generation space
About fourteen or eighteen feet away
Don’t bother until the present day
He put the special stains on his arm
Where there are long forgotten rooms
Twelve years I've walked the streets
I’ll pray for your soft affections
Such as she’s been taught to watch
Oh my love, this means so much to me
How long will you hold on to my love
Hello there, hello there, honey baby
The only sensible person’s opinion
There is no doubt I don't get higher
To turn through your infinite nights
What are you’re saying to yourself
Why is it time to change your image?
I feel the pressure of all the stars
No matter how beautiful your body is
Recruiting my buddy John the Apostle
This place is not what it used to be
When you gotta push it to the ground
Isn't she going to make it this way?
You’ll always be a part of my mind
The air cannot find its way into you
Tired of keeping the innocent silent
But just within the next two minutes
The sparks go from inside your heart
I should get some friends in my band
You’re the reason I had to move in
Everybody else will want to catch up
That smile’s what you pay us to do
Don’t treat me like something else
I’m standing on the white corridor
Waking up in the middle of the night
Sweet dreams of my hard-fought trade
While a dinosaur bird’s head falls
The ship will sink on April solstice
Who doesn't believe in divine power?
Let's go down to Stonewall Cafeteria
We gave up when you told us the news
Going down the white and red tunnels
She wants you to pick up your pieces
Dancing to the beat of your own drum
Little devil, you’re a rising star
Didn't want to make your heart throw
Each building comes full steam ahead
Are the years of pursuit around you?
Down with your butter-swinging leads
Why has it been so long since I did?
I will show you where it feels right
Lies that you’ve put in your mind
You’re going to stay here forever
Sailing high through the silent sky
The prettiest life you've ever seen
She asked you if she wanted a dream
Lest we keep flying through the sky
And you don’t take my word for it
And the double life’s in conflict
All the speed making this show reel
You are exactly where I ought to be
Accepting the things you're good at
You fought through some stupid game
But instead we all look down on you
Got up inside and ready for our son
Sounds like the shadow falls on you
Are the pills faster than our eyes?
What made you think I could escape?
It's getting cold up in the morning
It’s not like you've ever seen me
We had friends dead for generations
Blood being poured down the streets
Watch out on the lonesome corridors
Stars a million volts down the line
They’ve got faces against mirrors
Throw me into all kinds of patterns
The destruction that is laid within
One hundred, two hundred times over
Damn, this is how you paint a story
To make you want to lose your peace
Dirty dreams are turned upside down
The people and voices of presidents
I was going through all these shows
I’ve got all the wind in my sails
Your world is just a piece of stone
Your plan is only to kill a warning
And so I’ve got this squinted eye
Flown away by one sick old cannibal
Love that the ground changes colors
Think of what you’ve been through
Most of the time, it’s your fault
Some people think they've never met
She’s got more than meets the eye
I still don’t have the holy order
You're just gonna wake up next door
Diving in title: While I grow older
They looked at you with cold hatred
Two children keeping their faces up
Your silhouette walks down the road
Saying I'm gonna do it if you wanna
To say the wildest thing to someone
Though that all comes crashing down
Reminds me of a world I made in bed
You're gonna hit the ground running
Love is a thousand different beasts
Love stick me like a stick of nails
When my smiling eyes meet my shadow
You’re looking through this slate
Saw the figures of countless people
You’ve never really had a thought
As long as I watch the country fall
Getting lost and never getting lost
Life is pretty much the high priest
Let's show what kind of hate we are
Abandoned, shell-shocked, searching
Sounds like a thousand other things
Your mind is so full of simple blue
Want to be the master of my destiny
They come through what’s possible
You don’t deserve to be around me
Will all the weeping be kept alive?
Maybe she'll someday become a saint
To see the diamonds cut off my hair
How he always pretends he found her
So why don't I have money to spend?
I still can’t seem to look at it
Night light under the silver light
We move past that unspoken tension
He sure looks like a hospital-girl
You know how to make my heart sing
Ain't there nothing wrong with me?
Could be you’re madder than hate
And if it all ends on the same day
Do you know how to take it from me
Try to see him a while in the haze
There were no waste of their money
They mumble more than it’s worth
He turned my bedroom into a casino
I’ve never seen anything like it
I’m sorry for every little thing
You don’t want to call your name
What you look like in a photograph
That movie was much too old to see
Been sick and tired of telling you
Sit side-by-side across the street
Do something you didn't mean to do
But what does the world look like?
See all the emotions and movements
Shes the ground with a dead anchor
I’ve been watching you for hours
Where I’m bending over backwards
Things we talked about in my youth
Tears off their stammering bottles
The shots the rays-screens shot me
Grandma died as she sailed the sun
Only good dreams ever make the lie
To be buried with your tail behind
And thought he would keep a secret
Battle ready for the outside world
Ummmmm, how can I sit on my hands?
Your medicine brings me to nowhere
Something that never quite existed
Oh, and someone’s been caught up
Where all the Christian money went
Dancing around like it’s forever
Lonely are the lights of the earth
I’m alive in front of the mirror
She may have gone a little too far
Today I know what you’re feeling
When someone else brings you money
A feeling that this was gonna last
Can you even put on that monologue
Things that may or may not survive
I don’t care where it’s headed
A nine-year old living with demons
We have known each other for years
Punch through every roulette wheel
While I wait for the month to come
Life can play a role in my destiny
I don't know why you’ve done it?
Reading’s like leaving the house
And now it’s time to say goodbye
We've been living within ourselves
The only thing higher than winning
It’s a little bit less than here
Talking beautiful in your own eyes
Two good times we could have known
I can’t get used to my existence
We are nothing but dead old people
What will I do to your affection ?
I get around from where you got to
So I don't feel so guilty’s here
Into a world that was only outside
I looked down on my troubled youth
Well it depends on where you're at
When the enemy comes on the attack
Excuse me but I’m doing it wrong
Keep making promises to the people
Trying to get it to leave me alone
Excerpted from one star in the sky
It didn't look like you’re there
Just like the body can never catch
Running down against your own wall
Tried to make you look comfortable
She said we found a new sweet kiss
They didn’t reveal their secrets
Someone who can change in his name
Today you can ride the dark forces
We can. Like putting my mind on it
A place without anything but books
Playing and singing in the evening
I think I’ve been getting kicked
She didn't tell me all the answers
Wondering why there is no tomorrow
To cower so that the wind can blow
We wanna shoot the shit from below
I was so fucked with fucking power
The sounds of morning intermission
My brain doesn't know it’s wrong
You’ve got no right to complain
I feel kinda bad because I didn't
The way to check somebody's dream
Still looking at this empty place
This game - meaning so much to me
Where he said salvation comes out
You’ve seen me walk my highroad
But you’ll find me in the world
And I wasn't there at the wedding
Found something that interests me
That ship walked through the moon
Flashing through a distorted mind
Nothing could have made me scream
Ain’t like the world’s a city
A position held dear to her heart
Let's just get a fancy little gig
Everything good you are right now
It shouldn't be so much like that
Revolution that kills all mankind
Really just a boring ball of fire
What's your boss supposed to say?
Getting nowhere’s all they want
When it comes down to what I know
You’re not the only one to love
His feet are getting stashed away
The door opens in the late summer
Spent one of the days in solitary
The old man’s side of the story
During the month before Christmas
Screeching and walking to the end
I had to take care of my business
You’ve got a fire in your brain
Why you’re off to a great start
Coming here’s nothing but pride
Many of the times the truth hangs
Drop the worst of your silly ways
My imagination just seems endless
I looked down into the deep ocean
Well hello, you’re looking down
Help me if they're looking for it
Totally never gonna look the same
Maybe you can come back tomorrow?
Taking those brainwashed whispers
People on Sunday know what I mean
The Lion, the Hare, the Bumblebee
Another journey through the night
Sleep and write your tired lyrics
Your life is no longer a cakewalk
Trying to win by splitting pixels
Within six or seven hundred yards
Wonder why you’ve gotta be here
We shouldn't pay attention to you
Come on now, that leaves the room
I'll take a girl if she calls you
Laugh in the face of every belief
You’re feeling a little wistful
I am desperate to get out of here
Your bones belong on his shoulder
Someone else will find the ground
You left the army out in the open
Someone else’s doing it for you
I’ll use them to change my mind
I wonder what lives in that hell?
Starting singing after she leaves
The truth before all the lawsuits
My dream is watching the sun rise
True life and an hourglass vision
I feel like a band of crazy thugs
Well I know where you’re parked
Once again, he brings you nowhere
Carefully thinking about tomorrow
Chasing an ever-increasing appeal
Why’ve you never been the same?
Finders only deep inside yourself
I got some pretty sick cutie mark
I’m not looking through the day
A thousand pages of a smooth head
And the soundtrack to gangsta rap
Don’t have to feel bad about it
Freedom to act like I'm in a mine
Isn't the only thing that matters
The saints will sing at the floor
Turning the weight of my concerns
That leaves the other side alight
You can’t think of another name
Put your hammer back on your head
And she saw the master once again
Hold on tight alrightie’s right
Unconstitutionally rude to others
The acrid nest of godless shadows
Assemble the spark of a hurricane
He hung around in his little town
Is this brother an enemy of mine?
When you emerge into the daylight
That song you'd last love to sing
Farewell to redefined cold depths
Been looking for the time machine
You’re supposed to be your king
Reaching or keeping you way older
Each of us is a part of our story
Up on the freedom top of the star
Heaven and earth are still moving
Far away and better than you know
Alive just in the grip of madness
And now that she thinks I can see
Your eye should have been shining
Watch as the summertime brightens
Oh I can feel the heat of the sun
Let's go where the hell we belong
Save me from this current dilemma
You forgot to pay the grandmaster
Rejection comes with more finesse
Cutting and going through with it
It’s as if the world has no end
My parents told me to do it again
Everybody and his fucking brother
I wonder how many bars there are?
I'm not going to do it right here
Can only be sold by famous people
Pointed me in the right direction
The American in the wake of dying
Lonely wakes of my lovelorn world
Caught keeping your heart cracked
Back to making the place my dream
People you’ll need to deal with
I believe it but I ain't sure who
You could get your life together
Most of the time I’ll be lying
Beat their minds from the inside
Some people crawl down on to you
You don’t know it’s this way
Finds room for her evil laughter
You’ll find me in a restaurant
This is all I have, play with me
A-changin' like all these people
Things you see and hear everyday
Do you think you will ever come?
To sit and watch her life change
Say something exciting to people
We're all heading up for one day
Want to know, how you got where?
Grow up to become a complete man
I can feel it stalking behind me
Straight from the clanging cages
Walking around like the darkness
Everybody knows, dance to a tune
The highest worth leaving behind
Her hair is thicker and rich red
You don’t have to say it today
I didn’t know what I was doing
Working just to hold it together
Never let someone else touch you
And because of the way you look?
Put a little evil into our lives
With time comes your own reality
A little more earth is kept cold
I never understood the blindness
I just feel like I’m giving in
Don't catch me like I'm not here
Sick of having to follow the law
Twenty-five minutes on the clock
An ideal place to show the world
Ladybird, blind man's sweetheart
You’re been around for so long
Well one night in the grindhouse
Sticking your sweet little hooks
I’m just taking your life away
Ready to put up with one disease
Visions that will change forever
You take the shine off your blue
Through the teeth of my own band
I don't want anyone else to know
We need someone to look after us
Dark streets you dragged through
I see through all of your sorrow
Leaves your friend at the window
Behind the lights of your dreams
It's like a train of sickle pals
To the tune of Tom Baker records
I never saw you like this before
Somebody else’s in the kitchen
My bluesy eyes belong in the sky
To touch you and your dark sides
All my hearts are in your pocket
When little ones always want him
Thought all of this will be fine
Modern takes a shine to her eyes
And you've never seen his worst?
When you’re standing beside me
How I feel whenever I feel dirty
I can’t say with any certainty
Why didn't you just move my arm?
That you came into sight of none
Life - all you had but one floor
Crying and weeping for the cross
Prevent himself from killing you
But we still have a little to do
If you want a slice of the night
Leave me or I shall become a law
You’re going to send me inside
Have you ever met a golden girl?
I don’t want to be your friend
No way that I’m supposed to be
Pouring our blood into the storm
Please don’t make me a cliché
You’re not asking for anything
In the time when I was unearthly
Will you keep eating through me?
The silhouette of something good
You can’t help it’s so blank
That gets across the finish line
With sorrows of everlasting fire
My great-great-great grandfather
We just gotta get to our friends
Sometimes you walk into a riddle
Getting through all the pressure
In the interest of playing along
Sometimes I'll be getting a clue
You hear the bells day and night
I’m fine with the fleshy paper
She looked so little at the time
And you’ve got a question mark
Just the week before my daydream
No matter what tomorrow might be
The inspiration made him lose it
The good memories of wounded men
You were the idol of the morning
To give a hand to Queen’s soup
Calling myself the brokenhearted
Explain why you are a bad dancer
When ever that moment comes true
Wanted it all for the third time
He always pointed a camera on me
You’re going to be a gentleman
The dead, the living, the hollow
Don’t expect to move so easily
Whisper a street sobriety breath
But what if your body was naked?
Like the sound of a time machine
You’re walking through circles
You never walk through that door
Using them as a commercial asset
All the dead wings belong to her
The devil will take my dead lips
The envy of each and every other
Next train up's attempt to cross
We've heard his name in the room
We hear you’re blowing a match
Somebody's got to move the train
Started buying to- pay attention
He’s not gonna like it anymore
But there’s nothing you can do
I don’t care what he’s doing
Drink the ashes and pour the dew
Maybe we could have it together?
Watching you struggle with booze
How many times do I have to eat?
Somewhere, somewhere inside you
You watched me hide in a corner
That’s what life is all about
Snakes sing and crawl into them
A bank vault of all his friends
The people still call you names
In the interest of full harmony
Your life is meant to be pretty
Sign me to see that a dark tune
Caught up in a misunderstanding
We always knew he was gonna die
As soon as I can feel her today
Feel like the ant, someone said
Nobody was supposed to catch me
Explain that you are everywhere
What feeling like contact means
I think you don’t belong here
Things I thought of no one else
A garden cut leaves a dead star
Some of you will have to ask me
Instead of breaking, beat, bend
Underneath every shattered lock
You’ve got to feed me my nuts
It was like I had been shooting
I’ve been one for a long time
All the little angels in yellow
You started walking right there
Like running across the skyline
Curse, bury, come down on stage
Know how things are from now on
And he’s bearing the bullshit
You had never done him a favour
You say it's down to your bones
I’m going to give you a crack
Through the smoke from the fire
Cast the same pattern as we did
Here in a world full of shadows
Stupidity waits without warning
We had a beer when it came time
I’ll go in my father's shadow
Got a chance to finally feel it
To push your head to the ground
You’ve got some shoes to fill
Where are you when you need me?
If you’re bringing me through
He’s just another human being
I looked at you’ve never seen
In the safety of the Holy Grail
Just making it more like a city
With lips that have now sold it
Reminds me of my abandoned cars
And we’ll go as far as we can
From the pages of the old songs
Things will be better and worse
Waiting for you to be satisfied
This time I will follow’s way
That's a line to all my friends
Your fever sufferer’s created
Maybe I shouldn’t be changing
Lay down on top of the mountain
This movie looks for this peace
Where the devil is stalking you
I don’t wanna be anybody else
To turn into a petrified animal
Why has it all been left to us?
Scrolling along the city street
I wasn't thinking for six weeks
I don’t want to be his friend
Who wants love from their lips?
And I’m sorry it felt so good
Making my way through the crowd
Waiting for one of these worlds
And cold blood leads to poverty
Light that hangs in the ceiling
Yeah I’m talking to the bells
Wherever the fun's been brought
Your understanding is frightful
About wanting to kiss something
There’s nothing to make of it
It's pretty too good to be true
Touch me with that lousy guitar
Closest place to a burning bush
Right now you are still smiling
I can’t wait till he’s gone
Cast her memories in your heart
Just watched your life changing
I’ll never look my best again
Some people don’t give a damn
You know you’re in for a ride
Make your mind a hundred shapes
Yes, please don’t let me down
The sentiment has kept me going
You don’t know what’s wrong
That is what life’s all about
There is no avoiding this place
The news you've got locked down
The world is turned upside down
Wake in the middle of the night
We shall bring our own children
This feels a bit like big light
Heard the sound of my footsteps
It’s what I’ve been through
God’s sweet only within walls
Memories light up your thoughts
Search for the death’s ticket
These questions have no answers
Just leaves the future unlocked
They gave up on their low hopes
Baby you’re at least kidding?
What began as a thousand hearts
Fly from one crisis to the next
Looking at the things people do
You and I get together everyday
Everybody knows it’s the same
You’re not gonna let me sleep
Arbours come all the way around
Just wanna catch him if you can
I don’t have much left to say
More like a home away from home
You can feel my arms around you
The prison's broken and growing
Your door’s got one weird one
Yeah, that had been a bit heavy
But they’re all safely parted
I’m getting great at painting
Sorry for sounding so out of it
Free me from my disappointments
Your blood hangs over the river
But before this fading sunlight
In the open you must be a guest
Since I say there can be no fly
The name this city isn't called
I know it’s got nothing to do
I’m just wearing my bare feet
I’ll be glad I don’t go now
Someone’s breaking that sound
Dance to the tune of your heart
I hope you stay right next door
Yeah they’re gonna keep doing
Someone asking you for a favour
This child lives up to her name
You know she’d follow me home
You’ve not been ruled the man
See him be stronger than anyone
The attack became human history
What kind of sales do you know?
Will your boss get up tomorrow?
You never get to pick your wife
Back to what I thought it meant
Will you love me a little more?
The streams of something lonely
Right hand on the other sleeve
I can tell you how to kiss her
All signs are for a bad change
Beyond a thousand jagged walls
Through the crack of a feather
Touching you like some emotion
If it takes you some more time
My vision’s starting to fade
Perfect for dealing with today
Down under the land of hollies
Pictures of them falling apart
Wouldn't you like a lil' light
The need for a righteous dream
So you’re really doing right
It’s one of the biggest lies
I believe that for some reason
And there is truth in my heart
Love hearts fill their temples
I am sorry, I need to get away
Still asking me if I was meant
You saw me just standing there
Alright first time's the charm
Mumble with the teeth of Satan
Is the thing without you here?
We don’t see it’s long ago
Your thoughts belong within me
The dreams in the dead silence
I’m looking to move tomorrow
All I want to say is new stars
To find out where he came from
Time passes and the sun shines
We reach across and around you
A salute to the love-specialty
I could feel you all around me
You don’t go all summer long
What makes my nights different
Is it okay to be where you are
And the future of my existence
That's what dreams are made of
You've got your ears wide open
Your rages from under the tent
My love’s gone from my heart
The one with no candle burning
Im tired of staying where I am
This funeral is just before me
I'm having the time of my life
And you're taking care of you?
The dreamless master of things
We’re all turned upside down
And there's nothing you can do
I’m about to catch my breath
But you should stop kissing me
Good. Hand in hand with dreams
Watching birds from cloud tops
Kissing her with pen and heart
No one knows how long you walk
Preserve, protect and let down
But you know it doesn't matter
We shall see you every morning
Just another sad little animal
You said you wanted to go home
Needing to reach for the shore
Convinced that I'd follow them
He's just trying to understand
A treasure that will come back
I don’t care how old you are
Eyes that are kinder than snow
Sick as your eye doesn't shine
Looking around at the universe
The guts come out of his mouth
This thread ran out of an hour
My soul was made in a crucible
I won't blame you for anything
And the airlocks in the saddle
Everybody said we did it wrong
Feeling the thunder in the sky
Don't let the space kiddos win
Help us after this is all over
Maybe tell you my goddamn name
Maybe you don’t feel like it
In it we run, walking distance
Let's take this from the heart
Just like the average lothario
Burning down the middle ground
He used his lonely desperation
A while ago you used to see me
Where did your name come from?
Your mother said my adage's up
Here I’m going to live again
Somewhere that I can’t catch
Right before his mind can rise
The resistance slowly opens in
What you spent your time doing
They got right under your nose
If you scream and cry as I say
I want her lovingly taken away
The power, the control you get
We are part of another rainbow
Anyway to keep things a secret
It’s time for the great game
You’ve been here for so long
Waiting for a kick in the ears
Sunlit blues and shining amber
My relationship as you grow up
We danced a little differently
You can believe it's happening
Life being nothing but service
Laughing over all the problems
Jesus' wheel that turns purple
The only ones who like to talk
That card will come out on top
A rock at the side of the road
Where those pictures are taken
This is right before your eyes
A private place you see before
It’s not like that’s right
Place your hand on my forehead
You’re standing here tonight
You’re telling me everything
Mother couldn’t help but cry
Convinced I couldn’t look on
Then again, they are far apart
Take this place I’m going to
Made your bones like a trumpet
I feel like I’m being purged
Please put your arms around me
I'd try to become Miss America
What the hell am I doing here?
A little boy gets their nights
I know where this artist is at
You’re one of our moviestars
You’ve got to get through it
Those assholes only get stupid
Off all the towns in the world
What you’ve been waiting for
I see her hands on my shoulder
He (a wild beast) needs a name
When there is nothing I can do
Gonna see how you want to work
Reminds me of Romeo and Juliet
Walk down to a soulless corner
Throw him around like a trophy
Evil that keeps the city still
Too slow to call out your name
I could feel her tongue tingle
She knows I have nothing to do
Brings tear apart my existence
Sleep, reflection and one soul
As good as these tits of yours
This is love in a glass coffin
The fountain and one-starlight
Better that you’re satisfied
Wait for the rest of the world
I can’t go on until they see
When there are no restrictions
Ah, and he’ll touch my heart
We reach the middle of nowhere
When we went across the street
More than you ever could dream
Hear it all over your shoulder
Can’t leave your own stalker
Why can't we just stop seeing?
All these minutes of your time
Ours is the tale of the Shire
To know my innermost thoughts
Every indecision comes nearer
I hope we'll be together soon
Reaching out for another kiss
A man that can’t understand
They must've gone really high
Where the money was yesterday
Stranger goes by my direction
Send off in the order of time
I don't know why you are here
Split time and bring her back
You will be master of my mind
I didn't want to say anything
You’re making so much noise
Would you like to dance to it
We'll take care of each other
One of the only great artists
You’ve seen your reflection
Put your brain in your pocket
I just can't seem to get away
But they don’t want to know
I’m tired of this threesome
Straight to the nuclear force
Just taking some time to look
As long as I’ve been asleep
Your smile clearly set ablaze
To win up all that you missed
Can I feel your heart beating
I love you like I love myself
To the eyes of his own people
The seams were drawn together
Paying off these nightmaskers
You’ve only got one problem
If the mice still live inside
When we get down on our hands
Somewhere off in the distance
Wear it all over your clothes
This cauldron full of secrets
His body appears so immovable
Cast me as your foreign enemy
These days I can’t find you
Standing in line with the law
The quick time and once again
Take this on and take it away
And here we come this morning
Watching his eyes come and go
To use your enthusiasm for me
The memory is like a cylinder
As for a voice that could rap
Until you throw my arse at me
I've got so many sights on me
To make a game you were right
I’ve never had a love sound
With the jam and the laughter
You will do whatever you like
Hang in there and stick by me
The expectations that you had
I grew up around being scared
I want you all to think about
I’ve never seen anyone talk
While a person hangs his head
Laughing and crying every day
Giving you a lifetime's worth
Entire nation is already dead
Freedom just won't let me die
Fucking stumbled across a lie
Just so I know what you think
A chord that crosses a bridge
Attracted to you by the noise
The voices have been silenced
These trials and tribulations
Stand out as a disappointment
The hate’s starting to show
Spading through a dead thread
Behind the long and soft glow
All of my friends are singing
My bones have not been played
Try and let the nightmare end
Dressing, or in a wheelchair?
Trying to befriend new people
Well here comes the good news
Everybody's missing your face
Let the breath of success run
Ride me through this hellhole
But you still took it from me
You have things in your heart
His flesh overtakes his bones
To be cool with the beginning
There are forgotten skeletons
One of you’ve become famous
I don’t see why it is said?
Touch my bed with her fingers
The only time I feel like you
The only other thing I can do
Dirty until I clear my secret
I'm feeling so fucking hungry
Between the rock-solid blocks
I've lost all respect for you
Marching inside of our dreams
As much pleasure as I can get
Born from the prison we broke
The shoes you’ll be wearing
I’ll show you what it means
From corruption and red flags
Yes... we’ve got no success
How could I possibly be apart
Your mother promised me death
Twelve miles down the highway
In the only space between men
They started a chain reaction
Where I don’t wish you knew
And now I feel something good
Old virgins are getting older
You’re not supposed to hear
I don’t need it’s alright
I have been dying for so long
She wasn't fucking going home
You knew I’m coming to stop
You see the fruit of my sweat
The image that you have to be
The hatred you’re so afraid
Asleep’s ready to be asleep
You live at peace with a fool
As beautiful as your promises
Though time might have turned
You’re here to pay the rent
Can’t you feel the pressure
Been awhile since you started
The whole world's gonna dance
Any damn time will tell me so
Dreaming of changing my words
I think you have another hand
Waiting for the world to turn
I’ll see you when I grow up
Remember the love of his head
I can’t survive without you
While she rakes in your money
The life of living expression
Would you lie under the stars
If he brings it back tomorrow
Walking out from your slumber
From knowing the ancient fate
Your pretty eyes don’t hurt
What we have been waiting for
Your sister's wrestling style
Makes you feel so much better
Know that nobody’s watching
In the form of a split second
Sacrifice a unbreakable camel
They fought for what they had
Science behind building walls
Take every aspect of yourself
With the soldiers and killers
While women keep running away
Burning flesh from the saddle
What if you don't want to go?
Let's just kick the door down
At once confused and confused
Really good things were known
To sit alone in our honeymoon
And my wicked tongue can sing
Up and down in a million ways
That my time isn't on the run
The fucking country will walk
We had to be beside ourselves
I believe I’m making a mess
That took a while to get over
Don’t call me old-fashioned
Maybe it’s the same problem
Tell me what you meant to say
Let the scene hold us forever
Hey, what's that really like?
One minute you watch it again
We’re young and want to fly
Bought there in the deep blue
The flowers with winged wings
What’s going to happen now?
Everybody I know’s watching
Are you going to fail me now?
Say you want me to walk round
But you’re just there to be
Sunk down on the park benches
Hand-cuffed before we move on
The peace that remains inside
Is he starting to catch fire?
Running down an empty stomach
I’m gonna break out tonight
Entangled in an endless chain
You know who I’m gonna kill
I wonder what’s on my mind?
I won't feel the pain anymore
Trying to make the happy ones
Yes, really quite comfortably
Much of your body is bleeding
Whenever the night came light
Shut up when I can’t finish
Love with all your own pieces
Anything to help me get there
We used to be kindred spirits
Now I see where you come from
Watch his hand on my shoulder
Don’t walk in the same room
Switch to a different flavor
Allow me to keep you waiting
In all the glory of his face
But you can fly by your side
I’m scared I’m gonna see
Saw the dawn in the cemetery
If they’re looking forward
Freedom’s only opportunity
A key to getting things done
The quiet that fills my body
You see it from time to time
Freedom no matter what we do
Tell me the root of all evil
Underneath the creeper boats
Looking for something to say
Ain't gonna be unkind to you
To see the world in a lather
To get away from our parents
For a month there is weeping
People play hard if they can
Morning mornin', barbed wire
We die singing in his breast
That it’s a matter of time
Sitting across from somebody
Say please: Bringing me down
He always had a spare change
Been through their yarmulkes
It’s nice to be around you
The dragon will soon descend
That will be me all the time
What do I know’s happening
Fire within the span of time
Talking dirty, winking at me
You are’re the top monster
Something that is still soul
Couldn't survive the warning
One of you’s just a chance
I've seen no reason to think
What is the beauty of yours?
With no voice I’m gonna go
With the promise of tomorrow
Just get me through this one
When all comes crashing down
Sit down next to your friend
Black slips and silver wires
I can’t control what I see
Yeah, can't be anything good
Every moment made me believe
They ain't made this perfect
And you’re keeping me high
Down out on the warm streets
At first, we need each other
We’ve all taken my fingers
Is gonna be rain by the boat
If you’re bringing it home
He kept getting into my hair
I’m here to take you apart
My enemy gets a little older
Watching the love seed snake
Shook myself up in this past
She’s stealing more things
Just to take you by your arm
And we got to start laughing
Try to hear your frustration
There isn't time to sit down
Cool that mind control train
Swimming through your dreams
Every day my soul is weeping
One thing, a thousand things
I thought I was going to die
Believe you once and for all
Inside the sanctum sanctorum
Summertime in your love life
Let the wolves off the trees
Well, you must be forgetting
Wishing nothing but paradise
Loneliness can be everywhere
Well, you’re a businessman
You can decide what you want
Somewhere in a forgotten way
And teach your children love
While everybody else is away
You don't do much till today
Give me the name of John Doe
It's just way over your head
I gotta shake my world apart
Iron hands, ghost of a dream
Oh yes, I see you’re right
Inter-generational timeframe
Don’t take up your morning
Everything I've been through
Stealing from a soulless eye
You may have to keep in mind
Cover with a wet velvet rope
Walking around on the street
He’s the only guy to sleep
One solitary hour in despair
The craziest car or windmill
All I want is for you to die
I ’m driving away from you
You’ve got nothing to lose
Leave behind that rotten day
I'll get into it with a beat
A hurricane's gonna catch up
No one can sit on the ground
But there ain't room to move
You’re gonna hate yourself
From this knife to your feet
Determination is my strength
You’ll never find the word
And she had to change places
Don’t be afraid to call me
Overventurous wet and cloudy
Or at least some imagination
The true, a shadowlike thing
Yeah, it’s easy to be lazy
Just one more chance to turn
Tomorrow ’s the party time
It’s been going on forever
What really matters is today
Rude, jealous, and expensive
Then there's nothing anymore
Sixty thousand little things
There's lots of other people
Long hair’s a decent route
Baby wants to move out of me
Trapped in that silent place
On top of the mass slaughter
My heart plays the same tune
Don’t look at me like that
Make peace with your enemies
You’re looking at the road
From just another substitute
Disciples of the fiery skies
She thinks she’s a prophet
Caught up in a spinning haze
This ancient cannibal killer
Flashing through the streets
Leave me to meet your ladies
Amongst the dead in solitude
Watch your heart skip a beat
With the drug’s punishment
Going where no one else goes
Check to see who can show up
Watch how you roll my memory
Turn around and take it back
The streetlife ghost of fame
Lucky to have you in my life
Talk about our eternal enemy
And I didn't know what I saw
Things start to piss you off
The demons never lose to you
Your mom will make you laugh
To reach the end of the road
He's never said another word
I’m just turning my corner
An entirely different animal
You’ve been waiting for me
You’ll find another statue
Just mind you, all by myself
Say the support of my spirit
Smells the same as your lips
The good feelings of my side
I gave it to you in the rain
And that I feel I am getting
Your pride turned into pride
And the shells of times gone
Overhearing some funny notes
Which door is the other side
It’s okay to make mistakes
Represented the mass dailies
We are in the line of attack
Just be together for a month
Prejudice still reverberates
Swing the knife in your hand
Once again we fall into mist
You’ve got half the weight
Bam it sounds like a stretch
My hair can be up in the air
The nightmare has dragged on
In a thousand different ways
Heading into somebody's life
Dead giveth someone a reason
My horns are rockin her ears
It’s crazy how bad it gets
Don’t forget your cardigan
I didn't need to be bothered
The fucking highway's longer
It looks like I’ve arrived
She said I met her yesterday
Sometimes you’ll come home
Feeling an affair with Jesus
In hope we will burn in hell
Have all that oil and butter
What you would like to know?
One day I will be right here
The guards are still looking
We’re just waiting for you
With your new-found strength
When they know you are there
The sad life you come out of
Much of the world is looking
Throw their hats in the ring
I didn’t look so damn cute
That's why I came across you
Sounds like the place to fly
Everybody gets their own way
To crawl all over the border
Everything of good and evil
Give everything to somebody
Feel yourself in the future
Trying to salvage something
No one’s talked about her
Yeah but there is no escape
Something that I don't know
Search through every corner
And yet I’m growing tired
Whenever they say I'm wrong
Catch yourself in your mind
Turning down from a mission
This record is such a charm
There were horns on a stick
And one of my violent rules
For miles along the highway
What she called my portrait
Cracking out the first wave
Over the bottom of my depth
Mind hardens by being awake
While the sun's not shining
In the middle of the desert
That game's been on forever
I can’t play jagged walls
I feel myself falling apart
When did you reach so high?
The one that started it all
People talking and laughing
Your fame and your troubles
Waiting for the sky to warm
Take care of your emptiness
Steal the feel of your time
Rushing up the salt highway
Keep away from your friends
Stop keeping it in suspense
Some man's side of the life
Better off playing our game
You won’t make it through
Why don't you pay the bill?
Take your strange girl pose
Somebody you can go home to
See all my dreams come true
Then somehow I’ll find it
In her stormy New York days
That smile’s in your eyes
Tomorrow’s getting better
To face the evil of the act
Smells like a pair of wings
Time away, Romeo and Juliet
A look back at my childhood
You take the spiritual home
Your daily responsibilities
Any, do you mean, anything?
He might look fine and soft
Like drowning in the street
That doesn't sound too good
Made to fight to make it so
Standing amongst yourselves
We will probably meet again
Sit still in this confusion
Waiting for the perfect day
I’ve been waiting so long
The flowers next to the key
I’ve gone through so many
Your blood on my green park
All I want to do is pretend
I want to change everything
Morning I’m not so scared
And the darkness and winter
Losing control over my body
Thought to be a world apart
You could teach me a lesson
I only care where I am from
The singing of a dying star
You get on better with life
This is a meaningless dream
You know you’re a failure
Visions dancing in the wind
I want to stay in this town
They’ve watched you bleed
Tomorrow may be a nightmare
Just watch their skin crawl
Throwing a call in the wind
He can't seem to walk alone
The future from around here
Does not sound right to you
Please settle for a present
The static of your paradise
All the things I used to do
I know it was the last time
Headband worn over the hood
Another chain of censorship
Lock in when someone leaves
Right back where we started
Everything you've been told
Ripped up in painted papers
I don’t care what you say
His arms are tied in chains
Remember you’re my friend
All along the lines of life
Where there is a black hole
We didn't do anything to us
I had a dream the other day
Eager to catch someone else
Join our long and happy day
You used to be a wallflower
Sick of all this loneliness
And to no one in particular
When it’s warm in the sun
They talked past each other
My heart is the only shadow
His sandalwood is unhangin'
When anyone’s coming over
I’ll throw them the punch
Anytime you put your hat on
Didn't feel so bad about it
Give me your precious words
I'm almost feeling the beat
To go for the perfect match
When you drag yourself down
Standing next to each other
Moving from one to the next
Heyyyy you at the food hall
I feel the need to tell you
The concept of a university
Green beer at the breakaway
Making love to a dead lover
We can walk down the street
I'm supposed to move heaven
Your juice and nothing else
What are you afraid to say?
Hope I found a better place
Someone calls you the enemy
From the empty little floor
Borrows the lyrical rhythms
All the buildings fall down
We just burst with laughter
Where the trail leads to…
The voice leads me to leave
Everyday I’m a lonely one
Someone I can see and speak
With a nickel to the dollar
Look at this frail creature
Throw the wind in your face
Hoping for our sun to shine
Where you are’re standing
I cannot write this goodbye
Bring your future before me
Why can't you sleep at home
Millions’s worth of money
I used to stay out of sight
If you’re still all alive
Love is like an old brother
Seems like an attack by one
Selling the body of a woman
Somebody’s gonna get shot
Learn some American history
The monster broke the peace
When the butterfly sat down
I'm watching my lover sleep
Yeah okay I need to be fast
Your protection is indecent
Take their art-loving souls
In an all-inclusive chapter
Where my brother never seen
Freakin' everybody he meets
He’s had enough of hatred
Make your own yellow people
The class that is in charge
I’ve spent my life crying
It's not…it’s not right
It’s easy to roll in love
The mirrors and the flowers
And come back the other way
We all have our minds on us
Your vision will be violent
I don’t want to stay here
It's like leaving you alone
So clearly she has no voice
Until her grandpa found her
It will bring out the devil
Your shadow opens your eyes
Horses roll around on a bed
Here comes your big brother
Flying by a thousand sticks
Saves me a hell of a future
Nothing bad will come of it
Interlude after another day
Im not sure who to look for
Watching the same old movie
They’re probably watching
Black porcelain and plumage
Check the roll of your eyes
Life is just like your mind
Mister, start dressing down
With everything in her mind
Emotions are moving so fast
Down with the outside world
You've brought it from hell
My brains won the ball game
When did you get down here?
If you cast me on the wings
I’ve never seen your face
While you can’t look away
Come here, knock on my door
She’s not the whole story
If she tried on his clothes
Called all your fairy tales
You hold on to what you say
I get tired of watching you
Throwing the turkey carcass
Doesn't matter what you say
Shine the love and sympathy
Can't be bothered with that
Things that do don't matter
That's the way it should be
But the darkness’s a blot
Isn't this just a game show
I found myself so satisfied
We’ve got nothing to hide
The cutlass end that poured
Something bad in their eyes
Come out and just lay there
Your love is at last a clue
We know something’s wrong
Blood drips down the street
While he always ran for her
Break the rest of the world
Still nothing in your hands
Let your loving heart dance
No longer and never will be
Twentyfour patches of paint
I’m feeling sorry for you
I’ve only got one thought
I'm afraid you’ll take me
One thing that she deserves
Where the law's been broken
Walk around trying to cheat
Everything you need to know
With his still bleeding eye
I've made your pretty name?
Catch the street’s lights
Come aboard our dead planes
Bikes running on the ground
Snow over young white hairs
The feelings I went through
About all your awful doings
I could make you be so good
The pure, mindless zeta ray
Here tomorrow would be fine
You’ll never feel so nice
I mean to tell you a secret
Sometimes you’re an idiot
Where it’s loud and proud
Tell my girl I have no name
She’s taking a fair share
Stars and starlit corridors
Shadow threads of my dreams
Lady who won’t let me die
Someone that everyone knows
Down in the frozen cemetery
But I’ve got the red pill
I mean what is on your mind
Erecting a pitiful creation
Narrow at the drop of a hat
He could not help but shout
Falling asleep in your arms
The girl that saw some shit
The voice on the soundtrack
So, I come to you as a wire
Everybody’s doing alright
You don’t have the answer
I’m forgetting everything
To share my defeat with you
Well, that has gone too far
But you don’t go out here
The sun will set at nine am
Staring down from the stage
Little ears of a good laugh
Won't let anybody else know
Throw sand out of her eyes
Flowing water in your hand
No one’s fucking with me
It won't take long to sing
These haute bourgeois days
One of their own to follow
I don’t want your memory
The quality made him weary
Nothing really can be said
Please wait before you cry
Oh nothing is ever cracked
Till tomorrow it must grow
He’s getting one of them
While you are looking down
Looking over your shoulder
One hundred pages of notes
You go down my broken path
Put you in the wrong place
Welcome to the crazy lands
Know the only way you know
Love is made on the ground
Loving and trying to teach
Getting married right away
Feeling like you only know
Fumbling through sentences
Left my back to the ground
He’ll know what you know
Another day with the crime
Beyond on the daily stream
That's all I was gonna say
Where the dreams were from
Tears starting to come out
I can’t tell what to say
I’ll never stay, forever
You’re not standing down
Good looking and beautiful
There was one gentle light
But don’t let you at all
Diner at the devil's table
Time to go the way you are
I’m really, really tired
My name is still your name
Goze right through my shit
Smells too good to be true
This is a day for dialogue
A sucker who knows nothing
A demure and sweet feeling
The grass might be turning
I’ll put you on your ass
Through a goddamned window
You had it all figured out
See the terrible realities
It’s just plain terrible
The tree of the free state
Today I’ve had that fear
That I look like a phoenix
It is such a waste of time
Let's keep ourselves apart
Crashing through the night
Put the needle in your ear
Be prepared for the attack
The glow of his appearance
Since she'll take you away
To make you use this power
We know it’s a good game
Take control of everything
Where our enemies will lie
The waves sound like steel
You won't get through this
Wiped out in the graveyard
Tune in every goddamn hour
Just wander your free ways
We need to stop pretending
Sometimes the memory fades
Springtime tree silhouette
Throw me all over yourself
Walking behind the curtain
Maybe I can find the light
Crashing through your mind
So I’ve got the drunkard
Ride in a little amusement
I know when I can’t tell
Selling out the White City
Paint this romantic letter
Such an overused sentiment
Just try to turn the pages
Once the mood turns bright
After all is said and done
Preceding on his own death
How fucking nice you sound
The drummer can hardly get
See the forest in the eyes
The guy goes down with you
Carefully to see the truth
One hundred times the size
Waiting for you to find it
Or: To look into the abyss
At least now they do laugh
We are still at the bridge
Say they met somebody else
Moonlighting in every line
Try not to wake up someone
And didn't say I was sorry
From thorns to watery eyes
Someone else wants to know
My blade lit up like night
Sorry sorry it was so busy
The thrill of falling away
You’ve heard me say once
Last night I walked inside
That is now nearly to come
I’m gonna ruin your life
Feel the thrill of freedom
What the hell do you mean?
The first kiss is a memory
The same way to trade down
I can be as much as I want
You call this her treasure
And rids the world of evil
Though I looked more alive
A friend of mine’s death
My only source of strength
With your blood collection
Anyway you brought me here
I'm going to kick the butt
I’m sorry you’re stuck
Another time, another time
Oh, no thought comes to me
Heaven will be under a row
My two sons, mine and mine
I wanted you to keep quiet
We each must pay attention
That's how dangerous I get
Find it just the right way
Nothing to do but complain
Hoping to get on your feet
Just waiting for the break
Looking through the window
Cut through all the dryers
If only there were a trade
Because I’m such a shame
Doesn't look like my heart
Cut it out of the sunshine
I feel a burning sensation
To bare the hardest battle
Come to finish this sorrow
Finding your own salvation
Where I go after my windup
Celebrate the hopelessness
He once gave it everything
I want you to be my friend
While my flesh’s cracked
They say, watch out for me
Let's put you in this body
Surrender to what you mean
It’s time for the stable
The information you fed up
Take my foot off the floor
Someone’s just coming by
Something badly torn apart
Place on your garden floor
You kept trying to kill me
Why isn't anyone doing it?
It’s some nostalgia joke
Among your shattered teeth
I just can't fucking do it
Got paper and a cup of tea
Walking down the dark path
She wore clothes of silver
Back to some strange place
What is this place called?
I used to hang around here
Stand up and shake my hand
The moon leads me to sleep
Makes you feel comfortable
The bitter sting of defeat
Let's reach for their dead
A single and innocent hero
That feels like a lifetime
The cold is your hard fact
Dance out your exclamation
Stepping on the hard shore
This is a spiritual grieve
And in the next revolution
Walking out onto your town
My mother is talking to me
Damage that fades and more
The river whirls around me
A twenty-five hour rampage
Go back, I'm the rain king
Talk about going to heaven
It makes my skin feel warm
I think that could be cool
People who lose their mind
When the breasts’re gone
You won’t lose your soul
Stop playing with diamonds
Every dream is a nightmare
Come down to the fiery sea
I’m not doing it for her
I’m supposed to find you
I will beat you on the ass
Whatever you have received
That's it’s really there
I need to close the window
You don't want to go alone
You gotta think good of me
Seeing from over that line
Just hang out and have fun
Mouthpiece of someone else
There’s nothing like she
A voice that will meet you
Getting the reins of power
Every memory gets improved
Yeah, I’ve got it called
Watching the silver tongue
The beast and his language
Take a look at the picture
Now we’re doing it again
Don’t spare her memories
And smoke stains your eyes
Telling her we are friends
No one starts out with you
Somewhere I want you to be
Don't you want to be here?
Or describe what's missing
I tell you what to believe
Before the wheels come off
Her truck sashays her past
They worked harder for you
Fools say you’re friends
Ride and sing for eternity
Yeah so knowing I love you
He’s never a good excuse
Gonna upset your neighbour
Baby’s eyes are watering
Two sides of the same coin
Looks for nothing but luck
Your nerves are getting up
A motherfucking mess of me
I was born to pass my time
The distance is never free
Yeah, as the morning opens
Dark clouds seem insomniac
The reason you're not here
Shut up before you knew it
Directs myself from behind
I saw the power behind you
That were two ways to meet
You’ll die in this world
To see what’s around you
Envision a beautiful world
You’ll make me feel good
Tired of going without you
Please start singing along
No one knows I’m the one
Jump down the fucking hill
Let's go back to our place
It’s all life or nothing
When I tried to reach them
Things that I don’t mind
Deemed the love of my life
Up right then and up there
Peace is bringing men back
Told you so, fucking shame
No one knows what we found
Wish me a bigger red cloak
And please mind your touch
No matter how afraid I get
Street lights to the sides
So why don't you go today?
When I say that first time
Smell the sound of shining
While he's looking for you
Ever since she came to you
From the mouth to the lips
Twelve rap songs this time
We’re all stuck together
Everybody finds their feet
I thought she didn't exist
In the moments of contempt
Freedom feels so beautiful
From the garb of the night
You could have paid a fine
I can see you’ve got you
At this time I'll be alone
We never knew what we were
Everybody else on the moon
The rise of the tidal wave
They saw you’d sit there
Made the center of the lot
Stabbed into little pieces
Yeah, I know what you mean
I think someone laid down
Soon the thought has gone
Feel free to grow from me
All the people’s dishes
In the midst of suffering
You’re buried in sorrow
Bring out the dustweavers
Sitting still and staring
You know I’m getting up
My love is in the clothes
Different sorts of dreams
But this is its own story
Made to sound rock'n'roll
And some more than others
Grandfathered to the gang
I hate having to be alone
Hold it and watch it flow
But I'm not getting along
Smoke falls from her eyes
Of the mouth of my sorrow
When I ran away from them
Young Mary is half asleep
A constant stream of lies
Returned all of our glory
He's got your eyes on him
Things that didn't belong
You ain’t there to hide
We will make them go away
Enough pain in your bones
Memories of your children
Won’t hold in your arms
Standing next to a friend
Cause nothing can be done
To see his shit right now
But I won't see you again
When you become satisfied
This thing we call beauty
Spending as a millionaire
Everything she had before
Baby, it won't come again
Looking for something new
Yeah, what’s the point?
To try and hang ourselves
Sign me up on Good Friday
Yeah I saw it in the flag
No words for a part of me
You get this’s a secret
Right, I could only go in
Going to follow me around
How you’ll find my home
In the midst of her glory
A girl I would never lose
I must make her feel good
In the shadow of the ring
I’m never going nowhere
Put my hand in your mouth
It's easier to be a light
Bloodstains to our memory
Will you join us tomorrow
The dream you dream about
Her image comes on slowly
You’ll never understand
Your father and his money
What ends up in your eyes
You let him stay with you
I want something from you
Ripping through the earth
Strangleholds my memories
He'll know you’re wrong
Brought me all the stress
You’ll meet your future
I see you’re a wise man
Lookin' for somebody else
Something along the lines
Sweet and kind and caring
Down with all my passions
You’re a beautiful girl
God offered herself to me
Tomorrow will be changing
Disagree with my opinions
A difference between rose
If you can never get lost
Busted from all my dreams
How I'm looking for glory
Throwing me into a mirror
Wish I could take it easy
How could I be dead here?
Sweet dreams would scream
Somewhere a strange peace
Burning flames in the sky
Just how a world will end
You have been made fun of
He became sick once again
Between running and sleep
That terror of his father
What an almost noble goal
The deeds of his children
I’ll always be my lover
With all the people in it
What else do you suppose?
And one of the seed holes
This is my secret so deep
Why did we lose all hope?
And I think you’ve done
The pool hallowed evening
Well, we're gonna get out
Strike back and try again
I'll go and beat you down
Make some nice ladies day
Bullshit is just a weapon
Hey baby, what’s wrong?
The lace, balls, crackers
No voice is gonna stop me
Reaching for their waists
Where all the way to hell
That should be all on you
Couldn't ever lay it down
Beneath the crack of wind
Fools, idiots and bunnies
That's gotta be a mistake
Sweet dreams, I’ll stay
Makes me a little scratch
Where time is running out
I'm going out for a dance
She made a show out of me
Please please let me ride
Then I look in the mirror
When it comes time for me
Living as you seem before
Just putting up this girl
My woman’s human breast
Better terrify the breeze
The amazing tale of music
This won't have to be bad
Some day you will be here
That shit taste like acid
Not like the time of dawn
Since making love in love
Spend the evening in town
She threw away her pillow
I’ll live in his statue
Oh you’re just too high
No matter how stupid I am
Then go on your merry way
Tell me where she went to
Selling fuel to every boy
Yes, yes, yes I’m bored
Fucking rock of the night
Time to take on ourselves
No one wants to get along
You were growing too slow
And I wanted to tease you
This city will be in ruin
For a reason in your mind
Looking for my springtime
A thousand strange images
Becoming your own brother
Silence’s dragging down
Silent for a little while
An endless stream of love
Take my eye off my pillow
The stars are seen higher
And when we reach for her
Sorry, what do you think?
The only reason I'm awake
I’m so glad you're here
Pitiless-eyed blindsiding
A collection of bad deeds
We might let the shard go
Your heart beats in a jar
Taking pride in ourselves
Adorably close to nothing
I'll play some good games
Dismissed man’s beliefs
I can see the sun shining
Ever looking for your way
So need a two sided smile
Ten but no one is talking
In the interest of my son
Because you’re my lover
One hand on your shoulder
Sitting like she’s dead
A place where you love me
Crashing apart in my body
A thousand nights in love
I feel you’re in danger
Stranglehold upon history
Time to climb up the bunk
Different strands of meat
That means nothing to you
I’ll be alive every day
Why else can't you sleep?
So I do it with everybody
He just finished painting
He’s already been wrong
You’ve got a time there
I didn't know what it was
A mountain of dead apples
You go out in high school
Here comes the last story
This is all I have to say
Shadow of something I see
The star on the staircase
Let me just have a moment
I don’t see that coming
Down with the split china
Won't lose her sweet face
I’ve got a special girl
No need to ride the sword
When we’re all together
The sparkles of affection
Lovable silver inside you
I never gave you a chance
I keep your hand so close
Was born just to be alone
When I’m doing it right
To find out what you mean
The false, polluted water
Feeling your feet running
Hanging over the pavement
Who’s got no fight left
The world’s a mad place
Please knock the sidewalk
To get rid of your faults
But there's no such thing
Your soul won’t be long
Pissing how low it can go
The caretaker of what was
You can call me seductive
I’m glad they’re gone
Don’t make any mistakes
All the stones follow you
To Tender the sweet couch
And you just want to wake
My love comes from behind
To reach the great father
That doesn’t matter now
Scaring off every morning
Mise ruffle your feathers
Reading a letter in a jar
An eternally cool morning
I’ll give you something
That leads me to the part
Moving through cold water
Spending all day together
I think I'm gonna be okay
New bus trips every night
Doing your best to please
My friend and I are going
How could I possibly know
I see through your window
The force of human beings
Streetlights walk through
You don't want to go home
Your ground floor gangsta
A fight between opposites
Checking your goddamn day
Waiting for another dream
There’s no one to watch
A drowsy little boy's job
If you survive this phase
I do not know who you are
I’m going to be so sick
Take a shine to your face
I’ll never be satisfied
The up and coming tickets
And she wants to be there
Sniff on your fingernails
Starting here in a coffin
Preserve the deepest blue
Ask me, why I don’t go?
It's probably so cold now
The swamp fills the night
I can’t wait to see you
Underneath the heavy rain
My mother’s second hand
I found something special
You never stopped sobbing
Hey, look at me and dance
You want me to see things
And now the blood boiling
Where the heart really is
The Spirit’s giving way
Your lovely little sister
The brainchild of my sins
Here it is, in your heart
A song the insects of war
This hatred is contagious
Speak with hearts on fire
I was born into the curse
Paint over this amusement
The little island pirates
Ah, from Beneath the Wall
Mementos of the fat woman
With hearts full of blood
Your mind is nothing else
Anger flows down my spine
It’s just down the line
Can you tie me to a chair
I heard something strange
Pretty much to control me
Spinning outward at night
Like a few broken bottles
Angel as glow in the moon
Life is about to get late
They say he’s my friend
I mean the time and place
Watching their wings burn
Blood comes down in veins
The violence that remains
And I find myself waiting
Where the wind is blowing
Another way to end things
How the memory wore on me
Absolutely fucking killer
Everything you have known
So I've been able to hide
Should've buried the toys
The time has come to send
How I had to sell my soul
Maybe everybody loves you
Afraid to lose their love
Flying to the countryside
Hoping to cross the stars
Since you made me a bitch
What are you doing today?
This is what you look for
Gilded, beautiful country
Poets sing songs of death
With you down and with us
I never talked to the boy
You’ve never been apart
While he stands and waits
Toy and the treasure I am
Couldn’t beat this song
Dead men and sea children
More than a band of filth
Tells me what tomorrow is
No longer has the control
That is what they thought
Your acts just disappoint
The sun of some greatness
Freeing me and killing me
Dancing through the gloom
Welcome to the crazy land
And is it guilt you need?
Cutting through the lines
What do I get paid to do?
She really loves to dance
Things that make me laugh
Entangling me in the sand
If my money can't feed me
The sea’s turned cloudy
See all the gorgeous eyes
I will be your role model
Tells me who’s watching
You know you’re into it
The language of your skin
I’m trying to be normal
Why do you feel so sorry?
This is where you belong
I don't need you anymore
I don’t want to be you
Watching themselves fade
When you didn’t belong
First name from the tomb
He looked like a picture
Took everything from you
Night through your tears
Pushing through his mind
Say the love that I feel
Take it out of your face
King of the dance floors
Trying to catch a flight
Love and whatever you do
Clear love for ourselves
She never talks about me
You’re not even strong
If it’s Sunday morning
Green here, yellow there
You just can’t help it
Her boss is like a snake
And I’ll have you know
A butterfly in your hand
Ask a piece of your mind
I can’t understand why
Nothing’s left to show
Thoughts, no matter what
By the age of forty-five
Won’t they please you?
Keep their heart from me
Let's not waste any time
Hang your hands together
Let you become satisfied
I never thought of it so
Walking like a lost soul
Unapologetically helpful
Born of a thousand bombs
You’re feeling so ugly
You can probably beat me
First come, first served
A thousand years of land
Music died out of heaven
All in one neat lil' jet
The bargain is overtaken
In the heart of the city
Looking for a good night
Drink nothing but bleach
Your invincible old self
Different son of a bitch
I'll stay a while longer
Too weird to say goodbye
Walking across the stage
Don’t mind me, come on
Uncharacteristic success
A crime against good law
This girl’s from Maine
It’s nice to be around
You have to have empathy
You’ll never get there
Whenever I walk on shore
Wilder than I remembered
Understanding everything
I feel like nobody knows
When the rope fell apart
Talking instead of doing
On that side of the coin
Everything in your hands
And bring about violence
I ’m not afraid to die
Won't know what you need
Let the golden age begin
You’re so the big test
The same broken promises
You’re being pigheaded
While there’s violence
He died like you all day
Rockin' your cell phones
Letting your powers slip
But beware all the evils
You know what I'm afraid
Don’t mind if I remain
Right off the razor wire
Good things never happen
Living in a lonely place
Let us hide in our halls
Should have been warning
A red flag you won't see
Time no longer the worst
And all three of you die
As soft as they can sing
Stop crying all the time
I can fly over the stars
Even the fan has a mouth
You won’t pay the rent
I don't want you to know
Where do you want to go?
Turn your arms around me
My heart goes out to you
Another I’ll come home
With a shadow of my face
Interminable mental play
Breaking in from nowhere
While moving across time
I’m gonna find my tomb
The thing with the bells
Take me out of this life
Rolling over into others
There are dangers inside
Don’t cry for a minute
Don’t ask for anything
Silhouettes in the night
I'm looking right at you
Hey, what are you doing?
Awesome height and style
Just to pull the strings
You got one a minute ago
That's what my mother is
A highway under one foot
Let me tell you about it
Beat you up like a beast
She's just looking at us
Now that I have this you
Brought in from the dead
I’ll start another job
Until I can do something
The servants looked away
I’m leaving it at home
Saying it in short order
Your stomach’s on fire
There's no time to waste
People start to hate her
To the town I grew up in
Different colour palette
Thoughts could be pretty
Please don't go to sleep
My grandfathered machine
Sorry just never find it
In their blood and sweat
That made my life easier
I hope she won't survive
A view of disappointment
Foolishness—what to me
Say something, right now
That's where I’m going
How to beat that teacher
Wake up tomorrow morning
You’re all still alive
He’s all I ever wanted
White rhinestone streets
Come in and I will sleep
Distilled down her heart
The future turned darker
Curtain shrieking mirror
Fill him with cold tears
And then it’s all over
Some of the best for you
Some sailors cannot walk
Selling us rotten apples
Another man on the bench
Trying to ruin his glory
War asks me to surrender
My life is a blank slate
You gave away everything
And yet you’re smiling
All things you’ve seen
Your dirty little sheets
It took me years to lose
All of you falling apart
Reminds me of how I feel
My train took you so far
How I grew up in America
As warm as you can touch
What do we say tomorrow?
Stands outside this room
The rap music in my head
Rather find your friends
You come through with me
Spending all of my money
I come from such a place
The blood of King Ludwig
So, I’ll be right here
A life free of suffering
Hanging in the mountains
So bring it back to life
If it’s fucking broken
Things seem to slip away
The song is not the song
He has no need for words
A green beauty from cold
Take some time right now
Colours change direction
When this clock goes off
Yeah, come on for a ride
Never can forget my past
Watching in the distance
Push to replace the snow
Your tears start falling
Looking back in the dark
To defend the holy plant
The emptiness fades away
Visions of broken hearts
Maybe you’re giving up
I’ll get you something
My body’s almost alive
When I say I was pleased
I’ve been dead forever
I’ve seen way too much
And say how men are nice
It's gonna stay with you
Sing by the the lonesome
You won’t be so lonely
So let's just be friends
And I know it’s coming
I want the world to know
And I ’ve got no shame
Make a new fucking world
Staring down on the wall
And get inside your body
A lifetime of loneliness
Long distance train ride
I’ll have to be a liar
Staying inside your mind
My karma is my isolation
Still goons getting away
I'm not even comfortable
Can see right through it
Everybody’s wondering?
She built me the statues
Walking around inside me
But I have no one around
The things I try to make
Whose love’s been lost
But your suit is leather
Just broken up like shit
You’ll be here someday
Stepping over everything
Got the weed up your arm
Your sex is so messed up
I don’t have my future
See, the night is fading
For the Italian goldfish
Don’t hold your breath
And he’ll try to dance
Friends with a free mind
The whole place is quiet
Knife through my stomach
Shake your pretty hearts
You’re my old darlings
It was written in sorrow
Black virgin, naked star
There ain't much to lose
With my lust and my love
Buried by a falling star
Dreams and dream visions
You and me in the street
The grass colour’s dry
Ready to spit your bread
When they’re long gone
A young man just to give
After all she fought for
The force comes in waves
I’ll be fine and right
Stop leaving the country
Always gonna be like you
He lives your loneliness
Aaaand all that wildness
Got some flowers to sell
Great save for your soul
And you’re tired of it
Suddenly everyone inside
You look around the room
He lost sight of the day
I keep my life to myself
He’s a shock to behold
The despair in your arms
That way ain't all I got
No matter how fine I try
I can talk to you easily
Would you leave me alone
Finally got a head start
I went to sleep watching
Totally home in his mind
I’m an electric driver
I'll feel so comfortable
You’re just a poor cat
Things that never change
Please show me your love
Slapping his big brother
Mother and son’s juice
Made a bridge of silence
Dressed up for the night
Be sure you’ve seen me
The Satan worship begins
Misadventures in madness
Nothing other than a gun
Saw how much I loved you
Music answers the judges
The ladykillers of chaos
Just a little bit longer
Your father must be gone
That's part of the world
Your lips are never free
Waking up as a tired dog
And every sound you made
Then turn away, alright?
The reminders don't ring
Sounds more like a curse
I don’t know what else
She’d leave a tape out
The love you once shared
He’d take my life away
One of those great kings
I kept her some distance
Everybody’s so perfect
If you don't care for me
Ours is yet another boat
At the bottom of a noose
A little under our wings
All the children's songs
To know you're my friend
Through the show of time
A big old, hardhat river
I'll do the same for you
Get me out of my country
Things you didn’t know
She called me with a set
Either another mile walk
His face’s hidden away
When I finally got tired
You don’t do something
You won't seem the wiser
We are going to need you
Eat the tears I'm taking
Both sides come together
Are we comfortable here?
Comfortable in the mouth
Katherine of the suburbs
A squirrel only grows up
I found an way to get in
My bones fit inside them
Took her outside with me
I'm afraid of this world
Thoughts for some reason
The gorgeous Irish girls
Putting her mind at ease
Baby, slow the blood fly
You’re a waste of time
All kinds of life trials
First time over long ago
Take the girls for miles
I have no trouble seeing
Soon our money will come
You can live on the moon
The ground you laid down
Somewhere it’s alright
It’s time for the moon
Protect me from your ass
This is why I was afraid
In the bottom of the sea
Pulling each other apart
I want my mind to wander
Storing away my mistakes
Trapped in a prison cell
Until he ends up with me
And it went way too slow
Admired old swashbuckler
The city is built around
The truth’s all broken
I think it's time to go?
Taught me so many things
Talking to glassy dreams
Drowning all your dreams
I'm coming back tomorrow
A madman waiting for you
Your life could be a lie
They seem indecipherable
You’ve no time to hide
A time to cross the line
Written in an iron chair
Even deep in the tunnels
Suck in this jagged wall
Mouthpiece or facepiece?
I think she's got a soul
I never know who you are
Violence, hate, violence
A statue made of myself
I didn't care about you
Where I sit from now on
Hang over me like a bat
Now there are some more
Treasure in a glass jar
Everybody wants to ride
Live and die like kings
Should I please say it?
The lights are flashing
Freaks don't understand
The angry pirate stares
Don't feel bad about it
That ill fated for them
But all I see is yellow
Saying: That their time
Through our wild angles
Attracts your attention
A heartbeat unravelling
Learn to treat the girl
Doesn't really work yet
Got a face full of shit
For every bar you dance
The womb of a gentleman
Who’s really the king
Lying in your nightmare
Where old men came from
Don’t feel like dying
Great beyond your being
Bloodstained angel hair
A pair of blonde ladies
Precious pieces of lace
Searching for a promise
Underneath your despair
And then the silhouette
Reaching from the ashes
I may make you feel bad
I can't take it anymore
There's no room for you
Slip on my honey collar
Only one brainless goon
Never gotta be together
You get close to heaven
She’s lived the dream
Working without thought
It was off to the races
Iron on the silver line
Third down on the scale
I’m just getting more
Your blood will beat me
Some time to buy change
Not a side-by-side draw
We ought to be together
Milk on the ocean floor
Waiting for you to come
Too late to say goodbye
I'll go to the bathroom
You’ve got to go home
Time is at a standstill
Never the deviant dream
Fly in this green cloud
You know, you’re good
How soon will they fade
Sitting on his shoulder
The emptiness inside me
You know what you think
This is my little world
Give you no opportunity
Her parents flew around
Some time, close enough
Tells me where you went
Since I found it in you
Some little little note
Huddled before the fire
I need somebody to love
Depends on how you feel
You’ve gotta be tired
Who wouldn’t play me?
Died in a pit of infamy
You’re feeling so bad
Please hold down my key
My mask of a fiery soul
With a companion in tow
Someone saved your life
A promise of some value
Sorry it gets cold soon
Singed with this reason
Your senseless laughter
Find something of value
Never spoke that I knew
Happy, satisfied, bliss
Release more confidence
The one who knew right?
And you can hear it now
I’m about to set down
You’ll go, you and me
All men will be sailors
What do you mean by it?
But it’s so damn hard
My feet were beating up
We walk through a dream
All these lights parted
She's stuck to one side
Everybody else’s home
The basement seems cold
Can't stay in our place
Do you think I am wrong
Why if she shouldn't go
Where do you want to go
Freaks from outer space
Amusing the imagination
Your soul is insensible
She’s still inside me
Oh, the sense of wonder
You’re giving it away
Someone from our desert
Have never seen the day
How the fire is cooking
Things I love about her
Some dogs from the town
Who dares to touch you?
Your legs are deceiving
Your love for your life
I'll be there every day
We live in a nice place
Running through my head
Future's key to victory
A time for closing time
Incoming powerful waves
To find things of value
Too much and too little
From the mouth of a pig
The best way to go home
Tired of feeding myself
I’m a little sickened
All of us getting fired
Life is running so slow
Don’t wear your skirt
This feels like a storm
Walking down the street
Singing popular phrases
I've got no time for it
Her vision for new life
Don’t waste your time
While I’m busy crying
Ride along on the cloud
I thought you were dead
The sunlight fades away
I’ve got a resolution
Your more pressing duty
Live for my virgin year
I’ll be so damn tired
It’s still you and me
The health and the mind
Me, that's what this is
I’m making it so easy
I think my own problems
While I lay lying there
Hey, everyone right now
Way down on the dragoon
The essence of our life
Floating before the sun
Dreams are worth living
And she came and danced
I’m moving too slowly
See those blurred ones?
He’s lost sight of me
Need some reason to die
They began the sad days
I’m all things to get
Memory and imprisonment
Strung up around demons
From death and mourning
Own it and play with it
Anywho’s mind is mine
Dust the lighter I wish
Don't hurt him too much
Does this look like me?
Morning can’t get far
I’m beyond attraction
Like that she goes slow
Like my life is a dream
Watching starfish crawl
To make myself stronger
Here to see my tomorrow
I’ll put you to sleep
Will make our moonshine
Your passion is growing
Stars are burning white
Fighting to get through
Do you know where I am?
Cause I know your words
Told me to hide my face
Waiting for you to pass
The dawn of rationality
The flowers coming down
Oh, you’ll never know
And see the great light
Move your fucking mouth
This should be with you
No longer going to tell
And you’re so uptight
Walking across the road
Protect and support her
I hope you won’t care
And I will die tomorrow
They could be dangerous
When we’ll meet again
Sympathy seeps into you
The spiritual postulate
As we were killing time
Ride to the end of time
Half a dozen presidents
This moment comes to us
Admit it began with you
Oh God, I see your face
The sun kissed the blue
Visions of my own death
Music's called religion
I walked down this road
No one’s feeling much
This is going to be him
It took her by surprise
I'm well, but stay away
I feel my own sweetness
Whose baby’s to know?
Highway without my wand
Stash the secret jewels
Say he’ll come across
The sleep of the subway
Open your heart to them
Here we come to swallow
In the minds of the law
That's not good for you
May come if you need me
Can you reach the gate?
Seen it through my eyes
The illusionism of love
Pouring into the future
You seem very different
Boogie man, what a mess
The sun rest in my eyes
What color flowers sing
A young, sharp-eyed boy
Before your hands glide
The corrupt think I did
Putting you on our side
The casket and the veil
No more frequent trails
We will face each other
She's wearing a handbag
Last, glorious and holy
Blood on the chalkboard
She was waiting for you
The center of the house
She walks down the hall
Of no sentimental place
Money's gonna fade away
All over the whole city
Anything you need to do
Just follow your dreams
I’m out of everything
The speed of our dreams
In the thick of the day
Doesn't matter who wins
Good cop till the start
You make it hard for me
I started out as you do
While the sun's shining
Turning our back on you
Hiding behind our hopes
That you’ll know soon
Straight into the abyss
Intergalactic relations
No one dies for nothing
Slip through the cracks
You won't give me money
You must quit right now
I think he’ll tell me
Ever keep on keeping up
Jump over to the people
When didn’t you hear?
Couldn't have done this
He said tomorrow, yeah?
Made through a mountain
I mean my name is again
Stay true to yourselves
You meet another human?
We should leave a trail
No control in the skies
You’re all in my eyes
And I know what they do
I guess they had a clue
While you were watching
Weaving stream of sound
Put a grin on your face
I keep getting pleasure
Satisfied I don’t cry
We see the same concept
I’m busy getting here
You’ll never catch me
Years without fireworks
Wish I hadn't been here
Swing close to my house
Utter word of the Crown
Don’t try to get away
Down with all the noise
Four winds, seven sides
You did the right thing
The reason I said sorry
Try to make it’s nice
I turned up to meet you
Waiting for your hollow
With wings on your legs
The camel lumps my coat
So start fucking around
Which is why I want you
You say you want it too
That nobody left to buy
And so she let him down
Sorry to disappoint you
I just live in a bubble
With notes written down
Just roll over to sleep
I thought it was poison
Can I reach you inside?
Meet me inside the game
I can feel this tension
She's at the punch line
Just pay more attention
To find something wrong
Only try to let life be
You’ll have it in you
Shiver in your memories
I'm almost at the start
Walking in on my victim
Squeaking in the trough
Inspiration, revelation
If you meet me for love
Every country in heaven
Long overdue redemption
Let us make a new world
Find out how to stop it
He's got to win for her
That appears like a lie
The clouds now cover me
Surrounding the windows
Gave you all my success
Laugh at that rock star
The plan is to lose her
Are you going to be ok?
Blowing red to everyone
Who’s running around?
Come on in the darkness
Always-living everybody
Your belief in a shadow
Forgetting for a moment
In the narrow courtyard
Find another way to die
Hand me her sweet place
We're just fucking away
You gotta pick my brain
Mother gets things done
To ask him the question
Your imagination had me
You’re tired of lying
To the land of the wild
He gets from heartbreak
The last they’ve seen
I saw she led me inside
Got a whole new chapter
I don’t mean to judge
Put together the stones
Then you sit next to me
New leader in the world
Soaked up in loneliness
Live happily ever after
A bride, a shining love
Too fucking complicated
I’m really loving you
Totally out in the open
All you people you knew
And you want to kiss me
We should come together
Make it out of the blue
Like a beam on a pillow
Talking to you for free
Just like in the movies
While you hang in there
Find some understanding
Fear me when I grow old
Say something wonderful
What life’s all about
The card I don’t have
Someday maybe I will be
Give me your tired-down
What an incredible part
So he’s wearing a wig
A lawn is being cleaned
Try to change your mind
Sweet as the old butter
The girl I wanted to be
Sweet, sour, and smokey
It will grow at the top
I’m the fucking cloud
If you grow up with art
Albeit it's kinda funny
That bright sun of love
With wings dark and red
It was the night before
It’s not a good thing
Like you think you know
Is this all just silly?
Found fire from my fire
Standing up for herself
Like the wonder of love
I can burn ourselves up
Dreams became permanent
You won’t get nowhere
But the hand is weeping
Say it a thousand times
Too tired to have begun
Like it’s good to see
The beauty or the curse
But then she passed out
This way’s all pretty
A voice inside my heart
The movie I came across
Live forever in the sky
If the sun shines on me
The voices of the souls
New music’s whistling
Only feeling in the bag
Spamming out everywhere
She’s in her last act
The smell of bad habits
Inspiring all your life
We gave everything away
Holy men who’re dying
It’s time to lay down
I am still in your ways
Weren't they very kind?
When you touch her eyes
Your ship is the planet
Talking to someone else
Just a beautiful parade
All we made was for you
What a time to be alive
At last I got my chance
This town might be free
I could teach you later
Yeah, they call me that
Want to play the rules?
I don't want you to lie
In order to remain sane
He played me quite hard
I will take care of you
Supposing she’ll fall
And now they broke away
Long reach in the cloud
The open night walkaway
Left to our own devices
Everything up my sleeve
Things take a back seat
I'll never make you pay
We go on sailing boards
While I'm still in love
Our time is on our feet
Your songs turned me on
A little bit of romance
Don't cast it off in me
Travel a thousand miles
Climb on top of my head
No more explaining shit
Some man left somewhere
Who gets home the best?
Ain’t nobody’s role
Nothing ever comes back
Enough for them to hate
Holy blows in the style
Please swallow my pride
Only son to the blessed
Waiting for your master
We are a gang of deceit
Been quiet since we met
I was tired of thinking
The forest of fountains
Though darker than I am
Then don’t try harder
We’ve all been scared
These assassins hate me
Totally gonna sell you
We call you our lovers
Tell me what you think
Everybody’s laughing
You hold in your hands
Young men just like me
Finally, you look here
Your life for your day
She’s still spinning
In the ten-cent battle
I’ll never find love
It will make you think
Spattered an amber sky
The footsteps are wide
Inspiration in the sky
We all came down blind
And he’ll be waiting
That’s not our fault
Laughing at the static
Enough the golden harp
The smell of hypocrisy
No matter what happens
A human made of spirit
Turn the rainbows down
Doesn't get much worse
Looking at the records
Then what do you think
The moons in your eyes
Breaking your strength
These pants do not fit
Locked into your mouth
Singing under the moon
Chasing the brightness
Ready to burn my house
Shadows on an airplane
Trapped, dead, trapped
Guilt won’t help you
Like time for the wind
And my body is sinking
Alone on our honeymoon
For all our deep grief
Everything is in place
One day she’ll smile
Followed by the others
Looking for the anchor
To play games of dying
How long will it take?
The urge against kings
You’ll have it yours
You wanna dance naked?
Then I was young again
She wore down her ties
Bring my duties to you
Specially shining eyes
Dream about going down
Leave her out of reach
We can't ride you away
When it comes to boobs
Depends on your timing
The corpse becomes new
Visions of his fingers
Say hello to everybody
Barely fitting my soul
To keep my memory away
Gangway out of control
Running for each other
A photo of little Lily
Chasing this high name
A thousand ugly people
Never going to wake up
She threw off the kart
This is the damn place
What you’ve got left
You're fucking my soul
Oh, I know all of this
Nothing you can afford
You can smell her hair
I never took that road
The voice in your head
Can’t seem to change
Every dream comes true
Take away my affection
Anything you might say
You still want to sing
Your ghost can’t see
Kissing every last one
I take all of my notes
Let them call me weary
Made love to the devil
Throw away the secrets
But I’m going to fly
With devotion’s eyes
I will pass this point
Long live the innocent
We lived in the moment
I love making mistakes
Stranger voices appear
Look where I could fly
One that loves to know
Deadbeat into a frenzy
The blackest corridors
That I like to believe
Anything you could say
Because I will be fine
We found the same news
Your life is a mystery
Let's have your movies
That’s what you'd be
You’ve got a feeling
You’re a giant strap
Spinning in the desert
I got to come with you
Those first snowflakes
Lost it in your dreams
Your image as a pillow
Or if you don’t know
Come in there to dance
Through the wild world
Where your mouth sinks
Until my face is clear
It’s really not fair
Into the hearts of men
Right on your own skin
Gives you a good laugh
Very interesting story
All I've been was love
I think you’re well?
He's nice as pitchfork
Out of all the mirrors
The poison starts here
Ralts on a dusty trail
Our sides of ourselves
I think it is all good
You don't feel so good
Filled with bitterness
Yellow things need you
Too cold to be a lover
Burning something cool
Those inside your head
Swept by hypnotic wind
We've got our sympathy
A hallucinatory notion
A light that is broken
We sold all our hearts
She’s never a virgin
Streets out of the sea
Your love became human
His life's like a drug
Here comes the jealous
Turned out to be great
Who will take us back?
That day at the bridge
As near as you can get
Treasure and the magic
Can you see it through
Ain't all that matters
A very stupefying time
Thinking of everything
We flew across the sky
You have all the money
Take that hair from me
Can hear my silhouette
She should move on you
All power to the devil
You all pushed me away
Drinking in this world
Staying awake at night
We’ve got to pass on
Ice cream and kiss you
He thought I was wrong
A bowl of flesh to eat
Vows to tear you apart
Who’s at fault here?
Seeing the needle fall
These are love letters
You’re only a prince
Feel the fire and weep
Like a newspaper story
White out with the sun
The rumor for eternity
The god who created us
Talking to those words
Smells like rotten gum
I will always be there
Tears fall under a sky
With my lips wide open
And that we all belong
Someone named Willsell
Wonder what we forgot?
Get down on your knees
I know what my name is
Ice cream from the top
Now where we’re from
Shine the other lights
Buckets full of wealth
First man in the world
Caught up in the crowd
Mind always calling me
All the houses in town
We pass down the music
We all started talking
Your heart will freeze
This is the real world
To what you had to say
Just found the company
All God wants me to be
They’ve got no pulse
Little pictures of you
Disturbing our shyness
Everyone said you were
Find a reason to fight
Falling asleep is hard
Cutting into the heart
Walking from a volcano
A song about greatness
The White House salute
They won’t look down
Too deep for your head
What's wrong with her?
Looking out for myself
The only thing to know
You’re a gung-ho gun
Till I get myself back
Feel good for a moment
Glides down in his lap
Know you’re a friend
You’ll not be afraid
Down with a revolution
Care to play this song
Holy, this is so wrong
Wipe our records clean
I’ve got no interest
I’ll fill your space
Don’t leave me alone
Through the crying sun
It’s time to go home
Wouldn't you be happy?
Bully of civil liberty
Turn around in my mind
These are times I want
Asking him to get home
Cast your biggest test
Bloodlines in my veins
Lady of the seven seas
Night in shining skies
I’m’d be satisfied
Flashing out the doors
Getting out of the way
You know that you know
More than you can take
Friends on the flowers
I'm hearing your voice
Pictures of my sickles
Stand up, drag me away
Man’s got an oneness
Behind a black curtain
The miracle of liberty
The clouds of the dawn
I thought it was Jesus
Sometime you’ll know
You belong in my store
Half of my living room
My dreams are fighting
I will ruin this music
How to survive on acid
The last place to hide
Finding my own destiny
Tired of me seeing you
Put your brain to work
I’m here so suddenly
Same old hopeless talk
When I finally got one
Vomiting white and red
They brought your food
Time to commit suicide
Where dreams come true
It’s a kind of beast
Another years from now
Ride through the night
Turning clear and tidy
You’re gotta help me
The walls of your head
Where the future leads
Took my eyes off of me
Do something like that
Any clues you've found
Secret store of things
Pray she was your idol
What I cannot help you
We are my own creation
Sun and distant nights
Where the country lies
Right now to reach him
Bring me not so easily
Maybe you see me today
You know what you feel
Wherever you come from
Dancing with the devil
The money will be paid
Any chance you can get
To where they go wrong
You see how far we get
Ride against the cloud
This is a fickle thing
The ship that sent you
Running around staring
I can see my guard out
The fury of a mosquito
Run up a dollar or two
Some of it falls apart
The noise made me sick
Down in your own world
A search for the spine
The poet could hate me
The power of the devil
You’re a one of them
Midnight watching moon
Care to feel your own?
Rising down the street
Look through your eyes
The left lips are hard
I feel hurt and bitter
Ready to take the blue
Just another day ahead
We’re looking for it
Think you already know
We broke with that law
Your rights look rusty
My friends can't touch
Fly to your own memory
Watching my mother die
Addicted to pixie dust
As he closes his mouth
Asphyxiating my dreams
That said, your spirit
Sitting with the devil
I’m once again wrong
Standing up for myself
The deck does not help
Got no respect for him
More and more creative
Feel the things within
Will no one spare you?
Why you want to dance?
I wanna eat your trash
His messianic grandeur
Bringing the rain down
Can't seem to get over
Long before I grow old
One fucking art source
The air never goes off
I only watch you naked
Scales through my eyes
To me you sound so old
Got all these slippers
The battle between you
The mind is beside you
Carrying the enemy out
Don’t rush me around
An incongruous destiny
Music between her bars
Take no interest in me
For ten thousand years
I’m always like this
You’re in the parade
We won't be rid of you
Don’t walk like that
His hair on the ground
My soul belongs on top
His body is under fire
I’m about to dive in
Wanted to give someone
Trying hard to survive
What are we doing now?
Let's see how you look
The day she can't quit
Praying you'll succeed
Come on down in a door
That won't happen soon
Pretty boy, pretty boy
That night feels still
Sail away like a cloud
The smoke and the fire
Our name is everything
The liquor is drinking
Pleasures at your feet
Just walk in the sound
That never is too soon
If you don’t like it
Touch of eternal peace
Turned down the street
The sound of footsteps
To order somebody else
Somebody calls me home
They were never gentle
He couldn’t watch me
They teach how to play
Who’s got your star?
After looking for this
Something for everyone
Sometimes I’m afraid
Hunger, I’m a bubble
Throwing away his work
Confusing your fantasy
Waiting for you to die
Cool out and remind us
Blood written like wax
Other people wanna cry
Well that will be fair
Slip on your hard time
The sky was not shaded
Don’t come back here
The road has wide open
The man that haunts me
Well, you’re so late
With violence and love
Tomorrow would be fine
Yeah, there's some key
Everything looks awful
And they broke it down
We won't give him away
Staying on the outside
I know my life is over
She doesn’t love you
Hey let's make it stop
We’re doing it right
Acorns for sung sirens
Put a smile on my face
Not knowing what to do
Ever forget your names
It's going to be awful
Tell the king of words
The salvation in ashes
Everyday life is empty
Every place I’m gone
To paint down a statue
Seagulls of dark tales
Their dreams never end
I can see the memories
Reading down my tongue
No one cared about you
Make me believe in you
If I’ve never worked
Not lost in indecision
Tired of stealing love
Fools dream of success
We don’t belong here
A witness to my misery
She’ll be left alone
The eyes of iron fools
Flying through the sky
But I always loved you
You’ve seen me stare
Exhaling for the flesh
Move quickly dead oars
He’s taken my wallet
What took you so long?
The way you look at it
Me and all the enemies
Across your bony skull
To wake a broken heart
Sing the popular songs
Cool fellas with names
Is everybody doing it?
Hoping for another day
Too much time is spent
I’ve seen you crying
Suffocating in silence
To be alone in the sun
Here I go new universe
Something for the band
We always lived at sea
That holy summer night
Vanishing in my vision
Just thinking about it
Shivering with emotion
My breathing is broken
A shadow of that youth
The sky looked tender
None of this mattered
I won’t die in vain
I still talk at night
My soul here on earth
You found your way in
Got a little girl now
When you leave me now
Little precious stone
Ride like a butterfly
Talking to some mouth
Love all the feelings
The pearls of a glade
And the fear’s gone
Fierce from the mouth
Bring your eyes close
Your roots got buried
Fly all over the city
So now we belong here
I cannot believe this
Love and show me that
A beautiful red earth
You’ll know no more
Just as she will talk
Time to grow stronger
To drag yourself away
Throwing away excuses
The reason I’m here
Man, tell me your way
It feels like a dream
Some guardsmen to run
My greatest sensation
Got a true love album
Darkness in the night
I know it’s evening
And I don't know what
Made out really lousy
Love is your own laws
Tell my future lovers
Your heart is singing
The roots in the sand
Take care of yourself
See that this is true
When he pulls through
Like back in his days
Many birds over again
Strung between wheels
Can’t pay attention
For some I could hold
All the better for it
Rumbling in the water
Acrobat made me awake
Don't call me jealous
If you get sick of me
First and only dreams
Just a passing topper
Walking with my hands
Fading through dreams
I’ll give you peace
Into the lonely water
The only game in town
You’re always there
Marching to see stars
Sail my lonely spirit
Turn your song around
You made it to prison
In this sandpit place
If only you could see
What is wrong with me
You’re so beautiful
Hanging in the bushes
And with no holy flag
Waves back down again
It was a pain to bear
You know what you say
You’ll be my friend
Can see my reflection
What is the big deal?
A very minor obstacle
Under God's authority
Yes, bring me no pain
Stabbed in the ground
These are your dreams
Nothing you could see
The stars are shining
The fifth time around
How lovely you can be
We can call you saint
Fortunate to have won
Turned down yesterday
Stealing street music
I’ll never meet you
He never said goodbye
The trees are falling
Instinctive devotions
Sweet leaves of glory
And as the sun shines
She’s like an idiot
No sense going on now
Put our loyalty aside
One thing to remember
Because of your glory
I won’t take credit
Waiting for your song
Tackling this dilemma
A ring over your face
The only place I knew
Those feet are burned
You’re wearing face
You’ve never met me
Dancing from the roof
Where the pain is now
Where night is a mist
Right behind the tree
The money is with you
Can’t do it tonight
Didn’t move my hair
We share our thoughts
Throwing his hands up
The sun breaks in awe
Sunshine on your lips
He may leave me alone
But on the other hand
And I shall win again
Let the world tremble
This is the new music
Throwing away my word
All hell breaks loose
Where everything goes
Turn my career around
Take off your clothes
He turned to the moon
Take away the meaning
Someone needs to hear
You’re so maddening
Down that dance floor
We’ve been the best
Oh don’t talk to me
The love of the flesh
Through a clear glass
No one’s buying you
Shooting down traffic
We took you out of it
One of them’s lying
You, it’s up to you
Redrushing in and out
Road to happy endings
Dream through the day
I fell for the mavens
Won't that be pretty?
Just want you to know
Bring me out with you
Told you she was dead
It’s not your fault
We can go in this way
I shall move from him
All through the night
I feel so bad for you
Send us your treasure
Cupid's thousand doos
Love Is falling apart
I'm afraid she’d go
Lean forward and hard
To support the dreams
She is in such a rush
As soon as I hear you
Falling into darkness
I need you to do this
We know you’re dead
During the last dance
Nothing lasts forever
It’s hard to finish
You ain't really home
Where all of you were
Reaching the pinnacle
We must stay together
I’ve seen my father
A smile opens my eyes
Both on my high horse
Strain the old thread
Just a friendly smile
Everything seems fine
Tell me what you mean
Ain't nobody doing it
The ghosts in the sky
The books came flying
And still I’m human
Up close and personal
You know what I mean?
Its a hell of a fight
First to take control
Years pass in silence
And he makes mistakes
We all met at the zoo
Strip everybody naked
Let me feel your arms
I won’t look on you
Think inside the mind
So don't interrupt me
I can see you turning
The line fell in love
A baby born all alone
If you were breathing
Your fucking own home
How she’d slip away
The seeds are planted
Like he’s a lunatic
Looking in the mirror
I'm just stuck behind
Under an absent night
I want to see you now
Don't give me the bed
Lie full face to true
Where I’d leave you
Sail around the world
And I've got it in me
Get it out of my head
You’re a merry song
First and only chance
Rather cry for Christ
The marksmen on bones
Your hand on my heart
Shout your name again
Either we sing or die
See how stupid she is
Can be the sweet side
Everybody from inside
Talk your pipe dreams
An art in the kitchen
Take in all the rules
Blood still breathing
I’m busy restlessly
I’ll be your mother
Pours their heart out
Dream about the shore
Eager to meet the cat
Dancing stock footage
Watching the sun rise
You’re really alone
Speak badly of myself
Let's get round of it
For this is your home
Spinning the same hum
Going on all the time
As new as she appears
Cast out the darkness
Such a beautiful time
Stranger on a mission
Through the emptiness
Where's the bathroom?
Wherever you can ride
With the mamma's ring
And you’re watching
The theme of the show
Stop this slutty ways
Touch me when you cry
I’m cold and lonely
Man in shining armour
Just like an old soul
The sky does not care
I used to tell her so
Calling him a monster
Baby your little tail
Dogeared on the shore
The shuffling shadows
Burned from the crown
All of this is for me
Wishing you new lives
Most important to him
Blood-drenched things
The midnight softness
Love you and hate you
Taking his dream name
Your use and reproach
I’m getting jealous
Every wave of the sun
Live your life safely
Somebody I don't know
Where the music stops
You’re here to stay
Riding out the lights
And this time you are
Stars for their stars
Everybody in the town
The only human I know
You’re called light
I see a silver lining
I say, I want to know
Hell and all’s fair
As I walk the highway
My laughter and dream
We parted like a wave
I’m standing inside
Saw you bleed my love
It’s all about fear
You can see that past
It’s almost endless
You’re not an idiot
Waking up to a vision
Sit back and allow me
Oh my god I’m awake
I’ll need you to be
Hold down that pistol
Obtainments of murder
Waking in their quiet
Make a friendly peace
Can’t do it anymore
Flying on the horizon
The day of your death
Looking for your side
I don’t look pretty
In love with a person
I remember this dream
Iron hangs on shelves
That was my weak spot
You are always crying
Waiting for something
People will get upset
Your teeth could hurt
You cannot believe it
Don't be so impatient
Money is so dangerous
Precious little trick
I found somebody safe
It makes me so lonely
You have just done it
Life is full of deeds
If you could all pass
Your hard-earned cash
Just listening to her
Wild creatures afraid
Living through misery
Think it all worth it
The faithful get away
There are my pictures
That's why we all die
Nobody should hear it
Climbing into the sky
Abandoning everything
Now I see you already
Too fucked up for you
Stupid ladies and men
Drowned in cold water
Don’t believe in me
Move past that moment
Her eyes turned green
Her roots are planted
Wherever you wanna be
But if you’re right
Let's not forget that
Hey watch the singing
My life is too lonely
Enduring every terror
Blocked their throats
Don’t dream of this
The horse's gonna die
Didn't you notice me?
Memories come to life
While nowhere to hide
When you are all gone
Made an ancient image
I fought like a devil
Your eyes never match
Think and think again
I just need a teacher
You see you’re here
Keep me in your house
Mistakes at all costs
Forget all the shades
Heinz's lost his high
The priest looks cool
Just about to swallow
Like you got confused
My heart is your soul
To the dusty cemetery
Smells like dead meat
You’ve got no words
I find myself working
Hide the pathetic lie
With the light of day
Quaking in the desert
He's starting to quit
Stepping up your game
Been taken by a spell
I’ll burn your eyes
Waiting for the truth
The headless skeleton
Four empty blue pills
Squash up the emotion
He can't lose anymore
Before you were alive
And smile like a girl
Talking about my body
A girl full of silver
I was born to ask you
We did it differently
Mouthwatering romance
And it’s doing fine
Throwing balls at you
You must win tomorrow
The world gets buried
Like a nest of snakes
Where she goes inside
Weren't we yesterday?
To search for my body
I'll use your friends
I always took my kiss
I want you to love me
Taking on every creed
The whole train wreck
How well you're doing
Somehow go down there
My soul on the border
But how you got there
Rather play the music
Locked within my soul
What did you tell me?
A loveable blonde boy
You want it right now
Think nothing of life
Believe in one belief
Bite the heartstrings
Place you in paradise
The river and the sun
Change the brightness
Intrigue of innocence
And you are satisfied
A pain in the stomach
First time unheard of
Dismantling the weeds
Staring at the pillow
Please leave me alone
Absolutely fucked off
Becomes a part of you
All you’ll ever see
Looking at you crying
We’ll meet tomorrow
She got a great taste
The name and the date
Waiting to be taunted
Sitting by the mirror
Nobody lives like you
The moon in your eyes
This can't be ignored
The picture is broken
Trans fats get wasted
A pint of hard liquor
Of loving our singing
Back when I was young
I always got it wrong
All the rest are dead
Turning off your game
In the land of snakes
And I’ll never stop
Rekindled my memories
Hiding in plain sight
I'll die by your hand
Green mountains below
You’re the best boy
Wouldn't be a mistake
The cloud cut shadows
I'm going to meet you
May I stay like this?
I can’t hide behind
More perfect creation
Anywhere you could go
Show us in your dream
I’ll throw you away
It ain't looking good
Didn't move your game
They'll tear us apart
All the girllike gems
No one can control it
To tease a little kid
Living in the shadows
I’ll never touch it
A room full of people
Wipe it all out of me
Took you by your hand
Suck the magic carpet
What you don’t know
Then she had found me
The King of the south
What we had stood for
Fuckin down that road
Peace and a ride away
Changes to your voice
Making fun of anybody
It’s all about them
We come from the east
To touch every corner
You can feel so alive
Now and then you look
Two little sad horses
Time burns like water
Because you’re sold
Better hold your nose
Afraid you'll burn me
Can’t have you know
Going to keep running
This call from heaven
Wherever he’s lying
The curse of the soul
Buck, beat your teeth
Ten different colours
Love loses a big shot
Looking in the future
Sailing home at night
Come on down the road
Tired of getting down
Sailing hard and fast
We're gonna get there
Until no one wants it
You were looking down
Bring back watermelon
See your money coming
Lighthearted attitude
Turn it off from dawn
Still not yet cracked
Dig more into my womb
Didn't you know that?
Milk the star project
Hear me, all the time
You’ve been touched
Protect from the cold
And you’re the boss
Merry women get hired
I'm gonna be tomorrow
You are my role model
You’ll live forever
Won’t lose my share
In honour of the past
We’ll not be so old
Lightning of a candle
Throw it in the trash
Working on a painting
Buried somewhere else
Science down to earth
Connecting in my mind
Sleeping on the earth
Makes you say goodbye
Lead a singing flight
Want to stop and sit?
I’m changing a life
Rapper of white stars
Tears into your bones
Bring you your spirit
Your mother’s words
Oh, my mother’s son
Of your only pleasure
Remains caked in rain
You talk with the dog
To bring you together
Sail from your dreams
It was just yesterday
Can we come together?
Shadow my masterpiece
Or I’m going to die
Walk down the street
To find myself empty
Fearsome little girl
Put them in my hands
Head from the future
I’m ready for this
Don’t have it hard
When I’m like this
Sculptures of deceit
I don’t care to be
We care not who dies
Never seen the glory
We are his own rules
He’s a blank slate
Promise me greatness
Just hide your hands
Go drown on the face
The search for sleep
Fly a thousand miles
Go ahead and drop me
You’ve got nothing
A sweet warm rainbow
Cutting through haze
For the dead wailing
Much darker tomorrow
With all our bullets
Changes what we know
Your love is eternal
Rock through the air
Act like the newborn
My brother died down
Who’s all you need
And I see it clearly
My overworked mother
Play it off in space
Talking to strangers
Don’t stare at you
Let's see what comes
The Lord is watching
Ours, my only refuge
I wanna show you how
To sit with a statue
My place of pleasure
Used up the patience
Everybody feels down
Recruit your friends
I’ll keep shooting
From the ocean floor
Cold blooded secrets
You have no tomorrow
I never did it right
Where still you come
Death of a gentleman
High on the mountain
The only man outside
Next time I can look
Flows from your head
In a room with a bar
But you’re my girl
You’re watching me
This town called you
Turned out like this
Killing the kindness
Keep the power fresh
To leave you running
Long on room service
She can hurt no more
A month separates us
Whose eternal dreams
With a question mark
People on the inside
We live in a picture
We’re like pirates
Please don’t touch
God is gonna find me
No sound in my heart
Take me to my palace
A bunch of old songs
Don’t you want me?
Passed by wind blows
Me under the century
Panic, new and fresh
Your high is my high
I say you don't show
The only ones to die
Tell your lover that
We had seen my sides
Our dreams come true
I took pity from you
I know what you mean
Took you by surprise
Silent from the eyes
Makes your bed empty
It’s a merry dance
It ain't hard enough
You’ve seen it all
Fucking send me home
If only you had died
Where the sun shines
Let me reach for you
Tell the ghost story
Forget your devotion
Hooking on the stars
Please push a button
Streetwise swindlers
Poppies sitting here
That fire in the sun
Over the rough ocean
Fucking rotten water
Walking in the black
Talk of running away
A kiss in the desert
Smoking on the beach
Spending time crying
Throw the false grin
He’s fighting back
One can’t help you
Every day I am awake
On the prowl for you
I never spoke to you
I never got a chance
Coldness taunts them
It’s all wonderful
All the great things
They were my friends
That I'm good to you
Surprised to be here
That was a good time
The heart of my soul
Will never feel free
Trying to make sense
To make me look good
You’re just living
There are no newsmen
When you look at her
Keep my lips flowing
The candle will burn
When it’s too late
From here to nowhere
One of the wine-lips
I grew up in an echo
Looking for a reason
Put your love in you
Everyone else inside
I’m looking at you
And it’s no wonder
All around the world
Taking it out on you
Never put up with it
Throw yourself apart
Locked in this shell
Caught staring at me
First put on a wrong
Now I’ve got a job
Talk about your boss
My spirit's immortal
Some nights in order
You’re no stranger
Are you awake today?
Just putting it down
Got anyone watching?
The roads are narrow
The sun at the shore
Dreamers of tomorrow
Can I have a friend?
The noise fades away
Lost love in shadows
A feeling I can feel
Snakes likes bibbles
Sitting within a fog
Fly all over the sky
I'm right beside you
They're all together
The nightmarish mind
If it could love you
Of the human balance
Be here in the house
And soothes my heart
I’ve been promised
You now become bored
Underneath this haze
A large ball of fire
You know it’s hard
Move me further away
You gave me a parade
I know you’ve seen
Have become involved
Tune in how you feel
I have a secret soul
What else will he do
Where you went wrong
Walking in free will
Let you see tomorrow
Somewhere down there
Underneath your heat
Throw your love away
Please no longer see
Separate your vision
We stay here forever
You’re never there
Set your cage inside
Your place of honour
A divine personality
Pretty innocent girl
They sure never knew
Selling them saddles
Won't make you happy
Now I’m taking off
A corner of the room
She’s running down
But you have nothing
A kid walking around
We’ll see you soon
Turning into my body
That will be obvious
Snow from the clouds
The lonely emptiness
Never try to connect
Where I can hang out
Murder by the sinner
Come to a crossroads
Took my sister there
It’s all his fault
The moment is coming
Take away your power
All these nightpaths
Walking through town
Make a deal with you
You heard about that
And I died this year
Mind when I had eyes
Stomach full of shit
Run through the door
Stranger in our hair
When our hands touch
Trying to seduce him
Dreaming of disaster
To go on the rampage
It is all behind you
You want to be funny
Little girl dreaming
You’ll die tonight
Tell your love to me
The people like food
And we're going home
Walls thin and proud
Little Paulie maybe?
Time can turn purple
Singing over my song
How to make you feel
I know you’re fine
We should forget him
Mother is his bridge
Your love is calling
Walking in the night
Well, I don’t mind
Woke up in a furnace
The man with no name
I have met my mother
Jealousy like a girl
Into the human world
Trying to be popular
To break the silence
Learn me what I know
Doing your own thing
Kids can look at you
The dog now tramples
My vision grows dark
All around the table
Simpleton's foreskin
To paint your father
And then it’s back
Just follow my heart
The floor has fallen
Move the needle here
No more this burnin'
Long live, I’m one
A prince of sunshine
The passing riot cop
Well let me just say
All the waves I drag
That’s all she got
Just looking for you
Beautiful and moving
Situated in his body
Another city to call
Your hatred so light
Watching him tremble
We turn down his cow
Hightime has arrived
When you’re inside
Dreaming of savagery
Raging mad in church
Driving on the earth
This town in the sky
The city up and down
Fully blurred vision
Locked inside a cell
Starting to throw up
Kill me in your hand
Until the beast dies
A pair of sunglasses
Life is old and cold
It's fucking violent
The music of the sea
When I was gonna cry
You’re coming home
Down in the basement
Deep dreams are held
Seeing an open wound
The dream is eternal
One slice of history
Lead out the windows
Rather be a mountain
Sounds like tomorrow
A place of amusement
Act at the same time
Nothing says we love
Love opens new doors
You mean it’s you?
Sleeping all over me
Time is on your side
A rifle in your hand
Their nuts and bolts
Downstairs, upstairs
All through eternity
Son, you missed that
The art of the chase
Can’t stay neutral
Upending the romance
Snail with the vines
Carefully and gently
Put down your bridge
Silence still shines
Like your mind is me
I’m a walking dead
All the new language
During the offseason
Ready for your wrath
And I made a mistake
Old and new releases
Every friend of mine
Won't move the shame
If you think you are
What a pit of beasts
Behind all the stars
Giving it everything
Wipe me from my soul
Make my boy question
First time of summer
You have to be brave
While the wind blows
Higher-priority love
A simple human death
The old superstition
That and the freedom
Whenever I was young
Thanks for your help
Right for the moment
The world is melting
Don't change a thing
Take her on her walk
I can’t let you go
To make thee tremble
Peek through a cloud
To take a knife edge
You used to be happy
Friendship will fail
Tired of being a son
We won't be together
Don’t need my help
Behind the iron bars
Bought me a lifetime
I say don't keep out
The flight of a frog
Let's take the earth
One last minute fade
I’m getting colder
These trails to meet
The cage-eating bear
No matter what we do
Beneath the branches
Exclaiming ourselves
The suffocating soul
Kissed into my cheek
Getting up right now
A hatred so powerful
I am a broken statue
She’s getting thin
Been a long time ago
She's looking for me
Put on the neon blue
That hurts right now
This is the sunshine
Forget about a dream
Yeah, we're friendly
My eye turned so big
Devil for your money
She’s just uptight
We're not yet inside
Got to make my point
Love will send words
The bottles fall off
He's started to quit
Send me my apologies
We're no longer dead
Greatness you owe me
I’m the little boy
Down with your filth
From the piece of me
We'll do it together
And sit without love
Is everybody crying?
People flying around
But I gotta have you
A gun for your phone
Even dance backwards
Seen from a distance
You’re just joking
Stranger in the wind
Grabbing the freedom
I don’t get it now
It’s fucking alive
I gotta make friends
Here comes your talk
His days are forever
For a stroke of luck
Wait for the new day
When you’re pretty
An honest revelation
They get tired of me
Invent the new fable
Born you’re lonely
With unfettered love
Convinced we're done
Where it gets harder
What do you call me?
Live a different way
You know when you do
Upon the craggy line
I can see you crying
Fresh from the grave
She just turned away
I’ve got you right
A million miles away
Frosty black machine
Burning in the night
Back to the old ways
Until I lose my mind
A beautiful painting
Put it on that shelf
Broke glass in a jar
To make it out alive
A new way to say yes
The light is falling
Let me be your queen
Shuffle down my neck
Doing so is all over
Feeling the sun ruin
To make her hangover
But some won’t pay
See the clear colour
Stars smell of blood
Some buried treasure
Take another picture
Move into the street
Walking through life
Like my little bones
This human condition
There was me and you
Sounds kind of dirty
In between our lines
Somebody gets to die
Let me hide from you
We don’t talk much
The end of the world
A skull in your hand
Please don't let her
Into your cup of tea
You can fix yourself
Broken all the walls
Love from the saddle
Live a little longer
Your toys don't move
You’re on your own
Your ring of thunder
We will eat together
Waiting for the rain
Clones out his wings
Warm stuff to change
An anger-filled cave
Far away is the wall
And someday you will
I wish you were here
I can feel it rising
Crossing the country
My final destination
Love becomes foreign
I’m done with them
Destroying the truth
Discovered your baby
Used your false soap
Where do you go now?
Glowing in your eyes
Once in a generation
The mysterious power
Waiting for a scream
Across a barren beat
The blindman picture
Like heaven and hell
Blowing out my heart
Nine star attraction
You can see the laws
When they let you in
Some pain’s broken
I will move forwards
Rising from the dead
Riding the mountains
Down to earth images
All men seem to love
Straight to the dead
Everyone else's ring
I was new to the job
Waves shimmer around
You never can forget
Giving into the fear
Ain't a city of pigs
Looking at the stars
Born on their nights
My frail sixth-floor
Even pendant and dog
Love to cause sorrow
Always been that way
Any chance I can get
Cut up in your hands
Take apart my father
Uninvited from sight
The scientific wiles
Shhh’s off to hell
And then he attacked
Looking to the south
Want me on all this?
Larking at the stars
Looking for somebody
Is not the right way
More quickly in time
Deep inside my heart
Would be out of time
Afraid I'm gonna cry
Through the cemetery
Don’t make me look
Watching the sun set
Ten corners of logic
Grow up and grow old
Take away the terror
We got some bad news
The chain of command
I’m standing there
Like flowing colours
Watch me from behind
The king of anything
How did he get here?
Over in the mountain
Nowhere here to stay
Your biggest mistake
The sun can be yours
My fear is righteous
Got into it with you
In most of the books
A firework structure
Waiting for tomorrow
Do you like to play?
Not quite how I feel
His tears won't die
It’s his pleasure
Starting with white
You are going crazy
Time for a question
A storm in the news
When I last saw you
The rich and famous
Deep within my soul
Through your dreams
Tears began to flow
Playing for a laugh
Watch my heart turn
Sculpted for profit
When it ain't white
You want to be free
Chasing and beating
I was going to hell
Drop it and pass it
Take the butter out
To grow up so young
Between the streets
Waiting to meet you
You did it by force
Throwing stuff away
Like drinking water
Only pictures given
Bloodline is broken
Sunlit from my soul
I’m the wrong one
Take off my clothes
No one had any clue
All of my free time
It was only natural
Crossing the waters
All of them outside
Trying to waltz out
Dust your shit down
You’re the future
Until you are ready
And don’t give up
My vision is fucked
It’s hard to name
You've got me there
Scared for a minute
Passed within sight
You’re all I need
Right now I see him
How much I hate you
Gold in the evening
Through the gutters
Waiting for the sun
Ride off into space
A rose-tinted-glass
Unfolding the leads
The bus comes to go
While you lie awake
Gonna make us laugh
Fucking stare at me
Bring home the star
Underserved visions
I just came for you
Time is running out
Breaking your pride
Let the pain escape
Swing by the scenes
Goodbye really good
Someone gets killed
Got no time to lose
Do you need me now?
I’m fucking alone
Let's kick your ass
For making our call
Go for the highroad
Confused, desperate
Hark up a while ago
Talk to your father
You’re a nuisance
Crying against time
It’s not worth it
So now you're right
My path came undone
So he gets paid now
How could you know?
Take my word for it
Walking the streets
Why do you need me?
If it’s a miracle
Return to our lives
On a summer morning
Somewhere out there
With a gaze of pity
Now she deserves it
My place in history
We can't go nowhere
We need to get home
Gotta send her home
Foreskin simpletons
Stripes are for men
A dream of serenity
Naughty, sweet girl
And now it’s over
Longtime commitment
It had come with it
The fame pleases us
Silently remembered
Just a friendly lie
Selling every penny
Looking out for you
This is a good time
Buried in the trees
To be sad and angry
I’ve got no match
Voices you can hear
And he’s the king
While they are here
I took out my mitts
Living to the shame
Everything is yours
Stand by and salute
The love of singing
Going on a dead end
Walk your life away
Hello, there it is!
She looks satisfied
The armies of yours
Emotions can't wash
They’re all wrong
Underneath his yawn
Smiling’s own way
We’re all friends
The charm of spring
Winds of revolution
The kindness of man
It’s just like me
Just like yesterday
We are all together
The hopeless sorrow
Everybody’s alive
A princess shatters
Top of the mountain
Sacrifice your home
Ask me one question
Now we are together
To pierce all walls
Over the summer sun
I will stay on them
Start working again
Floating in the sea
Going down the ways
Let it come to pass
He'd be proud of it
My father’s voice
You made it through
Still feeling tired
Fly through the sky
When the world dies
These strange tears
I’m not your boss
Calling the age out
Feeling like a moth
Lost- of our nation
So what about them?
Born without a word
High on the crappie
A vast tail of debt
Came as a merry man
Sounds pretty tight
It’s tough on her
Some damn authority
Fly down the street
I would have wanted
Two holes of sliver
A man of principles
Is it running here?
Miss me by the hand
Just as I found you
Don’t let him see
When the sun glowed
What's the meaning?
Just the way I feel
We’re all in love
Extremely satisfied
The charm of dreams
Watching people die
I think I just sank
I’m ready to sing
You don’t know me
My childhood dreams
I’m sick to death
Looking down on you
I’m always on you
Let me say it again
He’s running away
Dead in the streets
He made me love you
We almost forgot...
No man stands still
We saved that woman
I’ll drown in you
Smooth as a feather
Broken relationship
I have no new money
Does it look weird?
Let's go over again
That’s where I am
Be away from it all
All over the street
I’ll be in prison
The dancing cliché
Going from sympathy
Starting with honey
You know how I feel
The devil wants you
You’ll be alright
Let me let you know
Put my life on hold
Watching you shower
Take me to the moon
We’ll get you wet
With out the misery
Till you’re awake
Turn on the display
Hand-to-hand combat
So glad I sat there
Send her for supper
The god of tomorrow
Say it isn't so shy
Cold take the water
I lived a nightmare
Glowing from autumn
Never listen to you
Putrid and terrible
Rain in the streets
It’s not my night
Too good to be true
Her God-given style
Downing the ceiling
Something will come
Can't find our nose
The darkest shadows
Where men like that
Got the wrong sound
Come down all alone
A mysterious future
I gotta be with you
I keep disappearing
She’ll be alright
Fly there's no hell
You asked him if…
Laughing in my head
We wanted the music
Floating in the air
Got the phone tower
The enemy walks now
I was afraid of him
Turned into a drain
Let your heart beat
Watch the sun shine
Changes matter less
The message of love
Killing the enemies
Made with no vision
Above every monster
Check your cupboard
Higher with the sun
Started him dancing
When we became poor
Eyes wide and tired
With all that I see
Gazing down as I go
Staring at the wall
Can't see you again
Thought he had seen
Will pass that time
Forget any pleasure
What you’re doing
Hurry and pick away
The dreams of Alice
Shadows are falling
I want to be golden
To speak truthfully
Deep inside tonight
Locked up all night
It’s an acrid day
Things I cannot see
Death does fear you
Can you find an ad?
Search for a chance
Of anger and sorrow
Nothing good to say
We really fucked up
People don’t know
Bound down and dead
Let's talk rainbows
I can never be good
The desert's boring
Push your legs down
Try to keep me warm
We will ride it out
Put together a song
Fall off the planet
Slap your hand away
I’m dying of envy
Where the crying is
High in the morning
Such an easy target
Selling the romance
It’s getting late
My victim’s guilt
Wherever I could be
Care for your money
Join me in his arms
Great western smoke
Hard more like hell
And I didn’t know
When the sun shines
I knew she was mine
I feel I’m doomed
The new seven stars
Dancing a fine tune
From street to gate
I’ll cry out loud
Calling to his face
Say it ain't for me
A sickness of flesh
Tired of the others
I can be an old man
Make a matter of it
Go through with you
I can look and feel
Nobody’s hired me
I can tell him shit
Punch for the balls
A photo on the wall
Any life is a story
That as she sees it
I saw you get ready
A knot in my throat
I’m getting close
In the game of life
Think a little more
Where we want to be
I’m feeling tired
His mind went crazy
I’ll just ask why
And now come and go
And you can’t win
Degenerative wealth
Stop fucking around
Moving through time
That may be the end
You can do my thing
Slow in your career
And you're watching
That day was unreal
Now that you see me
Watching the future
I’m not all wrong
So far gone you are
Hate so many things
Sail down the waves
He was taking notes
Are you hurting me?
Blow around for fun
Can't hear me do it
Paper or ink tricks
No one’s watching
No crimes on record
A wizard’s prison
Swing by my station
Wash away the ashes
Let me look at this
I’m floating down
The screen of death
I only see you once
Don't bring us down
Waiting for the sea
A new all-time high
I’m finally awake
I’m coming so far
Blowing in my mouth
In this day and age
Into an empty scene
To spark your skill
Live a life with me
When I stop talking
Young and beautiful
Fitted to live here
Return to the movie
That's what you see
I made a friend out
What isn't to fear?
Like a silver wheel
Strings and mirrors
Green plays shotgun
I’m gonna be home
I’ve lost my mind
Hit me with a brick
No point in burning
Where's my diamond?
I wonder the future
Not people you know
The kiss feels good
You’ll never know
Irritating dreamers
Crushing his throne
The closest you get
You aren't very fat
Sitting up at night
Through some people
Smoke in the street
You’re a tortoise
I know where I'm at
Do not be insincere
If you want to know
He looks around you
My baby’s the one
Join me, I need you
My hands are broken
Over in the dungeon
The dark doors open
Hanging on his head
What I used to love
Leave it on my mind
The nest of despair
This will crush you
The tornado flashes
No, you know I know
The pale army armor
He’s getting paid
The adrenaline rush
Love and redemption
Took her for a ride
The romance for you
We pay for his milk
As I can only watch
Our thirst for beer
Visions of painting
The sun was shining
My soul’s a cloud
Death of the unborn
I’ve been ignored
We could find a way
Thoughts and chases
Such a tricky thing
Burned in the ashes
Behind those asleep
Crying all the time
Just open your eyes
Burning it all down
Sweet sweet quarter
We look back at you
Everybody must love
Sorry to be accused
The tentacle shakes
On top of beautiful
All life is alright
Got the green paint
Know where they are
Wherever you end up
Caught in this time
Where might we hide
My time is too slow
Laughing cross free
Jesus talks it over
To a certain extent
Find another reason
Flying over the air
Flying a light sigh
The dawning legends
We killed ourselves
Don’t like crying
No matter how young
Reading what I hear
If you seem like me
Your saint’s name
No one will stop me
I’ve made a dream
More by the wayside
Be like Mom on fire
Love's all too real
I'm feeling so good
Life's too precious
A smile on his face
Over and over again
I’m of the future
Set your feet clean
The alarm of yellow
Disconnect them all
Little Daisy dreams
Is everything good?
Every fallen branch
Full of gutter glue
Dreaming of someday
Lost from existence
You’re a red pill
It’s time for you
All the way through
Here the skies fall
Time here I thought
In our battle-lines
I mean these things
Wishing for the sun
You’ll look great
It’s out of habit
A city on the brink
You died pretty bad
Under the half moon
Got sick of singing
I’m standing here
Madeleine from ours
With a secret heart
The dust is falling
You can touch a key
Nothing but silence
To fight the dragon
Sorry to disappoint
Let's not be afraid
More anger and dirt
We had lost control
Voices to entertain
And to live forever
God gave me so much
Another year or two
I still have dreams
Welcome to paradise
He knew I was right
I’m doing nothing
Silences get louder
Oh’s good to know
That keeps me alive
And forget about me
Can no one stop me?
Modern-day gangster
Drink the good news
She began the dance
Finally here I come
Gentlemen for a man
It’s hard to hide
Then there was pain
Take your watch out
Learn about the law
Where you gonna go?
Cry before the gods
The dream is my own
Back in the shadows
I knew you’d come
They danced outside
I think I was alone
All we've got to do
Mashed in holy hell
No method of motion
God’s gonna watch
Search for our love
Ten thousand kisses
Roaming the streets
Red sea to the brim
Freedom of the will
The colorful shadow
Through and through
I love you, sweetie
I’m going nowhere
She smiled a secret
The world of hoeing
Made of white paint
Everybody around me
Will you ever stop?
Waiting for a burst
Spread my arms wide
Hoping for the wind
Lonely keep waiting
With another salute
Return to your feet
Was that your king?
Driving in the cold
And then it is gone
One word in my life
The taste of sulfur
The dust in the air
Red infested carpet
We need to hear you
Move my arms around
Then a bowl of soup
Make the world nice
Waiting to catch up
It takes a village
Lead off with love
Laugh in our faces
Before you know it
This is the future
Gimme their melody
And to be so naive
Fill up and rattle
Rekindled memories
Pretending nothing
Drink what you can
Back to square one
All man-made crime
A riot with ghosts
While I’m flying
Whispering canyons
Paying off friends
The line is strong
Nobody's listening
The angel of light
Till you be called
Just staying awake
What was the pain?
Here comes healing
Now come to finish
That immortal song
Either move or die
From: Young Voices
You can take it on
It is called earth
Please stare at me
And I fell for you
You must be single
And I’ve no idea
It never leaves me
Pretty sweet place
Leave the light on
Giving you no love
Time gives me hope
Things we could do
Let’s finish now
Change an attitude
Sunshine, sunshine
I've got something
Above the stations
Living on the edge
My head takes over
The reason I exist
Back for the night
Feel it in my eyes
Don’t have faith
First things first
Best of all worlds
Took the girl away
We are parted lips
Take out your mind
She’s flying out
Made it feel great
See you all around
We’re torn apart
Need to understand
Just a regular guy
I saw it for weeks
My head in the air
Slices and pickles
Caught as a shadow
Here at your place
Brash and insecure
Something so small
This is your pride
Evil control freak
I don’t need you
The world of music
I’m still scared
I’m almost awake
Just to wake us up
The legendary lion
Scrubbed the paint
To get you through
Born to be treated
We will never meet
Round hand to sell
Can come next time
What would you do?
A rich, noble face
Up above the cloud
Turn down my music
With bones to kill
Time won't run out
Celebrate our King
The shadow of love
For three days old
Your hand with him
Makes you so happy
You stay the night
Before he’s gone
All over your body
Your skin is alive
Do the right thing
No real revolution
With the good plan
I’m fine with it
Their wives talked
Higher in my price
Restless by memory
So tender and cool
Warmaster, warlord
Take a fresh start
No other way to go
An unspoken legacy
Only you’re here
Dreams too extreme
You seem surprised
Here is the vision
This sound it made
For the better too
It could be a vice
Riding on the sand
Say something nice
Makes me so stupid
All your dreams do
Betrayal a bad son
One driver so much
In this windy time
You’ve been shot
This little square
And how cool it is
I grew up on earth
I made myself home
When should we go?
The waters of love
Think it’s wrong
To reveal his love
Time to start anew
She thinks too bad
Come to this place
Set a new standard
A breeze now blows
The shadow of rose
To touch ourselves
Keep her as a name
Naughty but gentle
Till you surrender
Skippered my brain
So do you mean to?
They take pleasure
Hate ties the hood
Smiling beside him
Me, my crazy lover
Checkmate with you
Where it’s night
The one-eyed thing
Looking down on me
I’m getting high
You like a picture
While we did sleep
Ice across the sky
An exact duplicate
Wake me up at home
Anything but trash
My neck is playing
All these warnings
Knock on the doors
Through the cracks
Through my parents
I’m making music
What will you say?
Looking at you now
I’ll be tomorrow
I will move inside
Attacking yourself
The milk of a ship
The desert country
Lady kneels for me
When I’m a woman
Brushing his teeth
Made your promises
The fly of history
That sunken prison
No calling history
Down in Washington
This is your world
Make your sun flow
Came straight down
Give me more money
Cover up the roads
Hey look out there
Now, what’s left
The sky is falling
Tears in the green
I came to save you
Feel it grow empty
All aboard my ship
Take a little time
Or thumps of grass
Been away for days
Trying to get away
A tight green flag
Oh your damn heart
Or I could lose it
Bring them my love
So call me manager
Cover me with tape
Our lovingly dream
I’ve been lifted
Smells like muscle
My life all around
I’m still lonely
Empty in your hand
Paint the sky blue
Leave you desolate
Represent the past
Make something new
Across the heavens
What a blessed day
I want to kill you
The forces of evil
Shadows in my ears
Hey, you look good
Their haircut suit
Kicking the barrel
When he comes home
Seemed pretty easy
You get goosebumps
I'll introduce you
Take one last kiss
Too fucking bitter
People get treated
And you’re alone
To need a bit more
Unbreakable dreams
Driven into a rage
Sorry for my youth
The force of truth
My child’s fault
A feather in a jar
Scales the gallery
His hand is moving
Then sell his soul
That I never leave
Honey wets a month
Filled with Curses
On a massive scale
The rope was loose
Well I’m worried
Feel the lightpour
The body around me
You can see it now
Last night in hell
Letting a man down
Accept and abandon
With an old friend
Too slow, too slow
I’m getting down
That you abandoned
Look at that smile
Thinking about you
Still getting lost
I’m naked inside
Mouths are planted
Friends and family
If you stayed here
Overcome the blues
Digital footprints
The sky is my deck
Coming from within
With white clothes
Excessive drinking
Lights out from us
Then you’re free
Sacrifice yourself
Love me some fruit
Hopeless in search
I’ve never known
Too strong for you
Drop all your crap
A drug-crazed rage
That she’d found
Bad ass over again
By the star towers
The taste of flame
Supposedly over us
Didn’t touch you
Many people on top
Need you ever stop
A fly in the night
Singing to the sky
What you did to me
Boring and endless
Where will you go?
Don’t you agree?
I should feel free
I could only laugh
Your skin is dying
When we meet again
Asap is a blessing
Wet, sweaty things
Bump my baby mouth
To claim the world
Know you’ll call
I know you’re me
My angels adore me
Secret and private
Said fucking songs
Set your mind free
Underneath my hair
Lost little worlds
Check out the snow
Someone reminds me
Behind the curtain
A trip to the seas
Just make it known
With somebody else
She still beats it
Good to get a kiss
We could die alone
Back of the tongue
He seems satisfied
Pretty white hands
After all the rain
The cold comes now
Voting for Colgate
Blood is the light
Hell isn't my soul
You’re a bruiser
Buried inside hell
Drink all you want
Above my crescendo
Mine ends with him
Put the phone down
Erasing bloodlines
We are like a fake
Right to the ocean
To relieve herself
I just wanna sleep
Born on this paper
That never happens
That he was lonely
Run down the stage
I gotta finish him
Stoked the passion
I thought you were
Send me off to lie
Wrangling a chorus
With a ball of fur
Scaled in splendor
Never come anymore
No, what happened?
A different ending
Play in your music
Take that on train
The grass grow red
His mouth is empty
Patterns of sparks
Pretend you met me
We did it together
All talk of flying
Feel for something
Really bad mistake
Light up the pages
The moment is here
Tell me a new name
But about tomorrow
When I say goodbye
Be quiet and dream
I know, I love you
So you'll be here?
Your make it shine
Better hear me now
I love you so much
Things you can say
You’ll like this
Don't turn me down
Shooting from here
Yes to call you so
Through the window
Feel myself afraid
Taking me with you
Mother of the Lord
Wake up your mouth
The stone bone jaw
Got all the demons
I'm close to dying
The help one needs
Singing and loving
I’m got a vision
Push me by my feet
Dirt on the ground
Underneath the sky
You’ve no remedy
The way she talked
The sun in my eyes
His look was fatal
Hide your braiding
Rather than preach
The ones who watch
That being so sure
Down down your arm
Stand up, out loud
Needn't cry at all
Panic of vengeance
Until they show up
Take my sweet piss
Harsh with empathy
Wrongs of the city
Love in your bones
This the last time
The lonesome night
Such a silly title
The power you gave
It’s your record
Get naked so naked
Where will she go?
Cold hearted heart
Grab up and wander
Only fits your ear
Thrice your wealth
Good for posterity
Let the news stand
Broke in your jail
From our balconies
I’m okay with it
Destroy your enemy
An Indian sorcerer
Sit like a diamond
Please let me know
With some surprise
And what can I do?
Talk about a dream
We are running out
Sealed in an ocean
Anybody follow me?
Water to his heart
Pieces of a puzzle
Every little thing
Keeps our feet wet
Seeing who you are
Took you to supper
You’re going mad
The prize’s fine
Those three towers
One animal fainted
To give you a look
Can I feel it now?
The pussy of guilt
Cut down the trees
A punch in the arm
Coming from heaven
Nothing you can do
Kitted out for You
You’ve never met
Take your baby boy
And kiss and weave
But where do I go?
My younger brother
Your scarred voice
I think I need sex
In a secret corner
That set the stage
To live with kings
Her lungs go white
And I feel nothing
My ear likes yours
Dream our big name
The words die hard
Flying the rainbow
Waving down a tree
Changing your mind
What I was good at
His sips of poison
Show me your pride
Tried to catch you
That's it’s okay
Within the shadows
Let it be that way
Put me in my place
Walking to the sun
Completely in pain
Please fall asleep
You’re a traitor
The king’s trees
The shadows remain
That crime is holy
Dancing with music
Glass leaves water
Imprint the planet
The mirror screens
You’re mad at me
Looking at the sky
Young crack dreams
Beneath everything
That will never do
Invite your family
Kill the beautiful
Drink's on my mind
Beautiful to watch
All you got to say
Burner's ain't men
Blow for the grave
Told me everything
Don't get me wrong
Visions and memory
But there was hope
Change your method
Hide in your wings
You could be wrong
To watch money fly
I'm not even a job
The times she came
Waiting for a sign
To serve the devil
Of lost loved ones
But then it hit me
Sick of the racket
Without protection
And I’ll be fine
Good for an accent
The sky will cover
Sudden fading away
Someday of my life
To share that love
Just simply higher
What's the reason?
All right with you
It really hurts me
Can't help but cry
Spoken every rhyme
Visions of the sea
I’m feeling good
I am going nowhere
A cloud in the sky
Swings at a parade
Rude with sweetnap
Move past the eyes
The caped crusader
One question ahead
Broke all my dream
One I look through
Light sweet things
I know she’d not
They will be happy
Push me through it
Lady’s trembling
Is buried far away
Roasting the ashes
Before your statue
You wanna go home?
Entangling himself
I’m a bit uneasy
Long ago, you know
How they were made
Hate, pity, hatred
No questions asked
Dancing like music
What is it really?
What you’ve seen
Screenshot my face
The fading thunder
Walk our corridors
Call me the madman
Shadows everywhere
That made me bleed
Hit the open flame
A nation of slaves
Forever speechless
Sweet old straight
You took no credit
Shattering the toy
A clattering dance
And in the morning
They had no morals
To prove you wrong
Lie down in a room
Go honey, this way
Visions of mankind
He’s being crazy
All of them crying
Meteors wet spells
Lady's hand prints
A storm of emotion
Reading and loving
I know your dreams
Desire to get laid
No-one can feed me
He’ll get a roll
We’re all insane
Steal of attention
Dark clouds parted
This land is yours
I’m here to stay
The age in the sky
We've been friends
Young men laughing
Wondering for life
Where could we go?
High priestly pose
That immortal soul
You and I’ve met
This hand’s open
A key in your game
The dream you hold
I'm doing it wrong
Explain everything
I'm gonna kill you
I love you forever
Perfect protection
A warning tomorrow
How bad can it be?
But I don’t care
His missing pocket
Seen the good days
Swallow your tears
I hear the singing
Laughs in the east
Lost for a century
Ready to get crazy
Climbing in heaven
Her new smoke time
The truth’s true
More blood for now
Oh yes please stop
I’m here to help
My soul is burning
What do you think?
You’ll never see
Preserve the world
Who’s impressed?
I don’t love you
I had their accent
Selling so quickly
America is a shark
Only we have time
Wet moving mirror
Lost in the stars
Love for the soul
Cruel red country
A letter from you
It's a good place
Need to try again
Down with sadness
Rip their muscles
A jet black stall
May take my heart
Don’t wanna try
Wonder the nation
I feel... my love
With what is left
Damages of record
Cause it’s okay
Across the corner
Roar on the floor
Making love again
For just a moment
The evils we fear
The streets weeps
A girl and a girl
Spinning my wings
As cool as he was
Shiver in my song
Very nice example
My heart is right
The head of a cow
Give me some beer
You made me laugh
Something's known
I know it’s you
Third time around
A real bandit boy
Chasing into fire
I will be forever
To some leitmotif
Fly with red coat
Down as an addict
Eyes in the hills
Here is my friend
It wasn't a dream
I don't like them
Give me your love
Inside locked out
Climbing the tree
Fucking say what?
Lying for a while
Don’t forget me
I will never stop
Crude free unmade
He threw it on me
Accept your place
Sweatshop brushes
Screwing someone?
A beautiful night
No room for error
Imagine the shock
I took your sword
Lay claim to fame
Drown the palette
Tears off my skin
We have never met
Try this together
To ride it in one
Evil in your eyes
Just another roof
That crazy memory
Inherited by fate
Asleep in a chair
Don’t be afraid
I can barely move
In your blood now
No search to hide
Who’d you meet?
Today it was dark
Different numbers
Surrender up here
This heavenly god
He pushed a woman
Way to understand
Such an ugly hand
What do you want?
Without searching
I'm getting tired
Using as a weapon
Don't make me cry
I had been living
The way you dress
And it got darker
Candyman’s face
Rocking my wheels
Vanquish the cold
Down at the beach
My mind is loaded
You know my title
To find true love
Waiting for night
Taking up nothing
Forget everything
We don't love you
Out of the forest
The filthy double
Sleeping you away
Rock for a reason
Money won't dance
On the calm shore
When it comes out
Here you go again
Down at the truth
Saw the full moon
A tear in his eye
The king’s wife
You’re my lover
A desperate dream
Can anyone relate
It's slow for you
Drinking rainbows
Walls across time
Vanishing my mind
Just out of habit
Jump on our heels
Strung with dread
I owe you nothing
Don’t forget it
Dreams are broken
Just want to help
My starting point
But life's a trap
Trapped in a fire
Feeling too quiet
What do we do now
You are the charm
Came into my body
This in the grass
I'm not satisfied
Up comes the rose
Grabbing my money
It brings a smile
We had no control
Release that feel
How did you know?
Broken from orbit
I love it so much
We stand together
Where he can kiss
Unsparing for you
No family for you
Can't fight truth
I want to go home
He has a mistress
Snakes in the sky
The price of fame
That I think I am
Brand new singing
Had another title
And half the door
Life loves a band
Being a commodity
Stands in the sky
The guard is dead
Burn like a fluke
Under my mattress
Hated and saddled
Panic in his face
Eyes belong to me
Just plain stupid
The city tomorrow
Seems pretty cool
Painful and crazy
Tell her I'm fine
Saw out my window
Just another fake
Love is born here
Don’t know when
And the whole sky
We don't know why
My real affection
Stood by my grave
The rainbow burst
That's my kingdom
It was never mine
You knew the same
I feel invincible
His love’s fine
Who’s doing it?
A couple days ago
Get at the inside
Tune your windows
And cuddle a deer
Somewhere, we are
Called your child
Rakes in the rain
I still feel pity
I’m keeping you
Lose your leisure
From time to time
I knew he’d die
Keep your secrets
A midnight vision
How easy it seems
I’m getting old
Burning the house
Immolate yourself
Don’t you care?
It’s your mouth
Rainbows and dogs
All over the city
Battle on my mind
Every thing I did
Never got to tune
Spungent on smoke
The mark of decay
A big china shelf
I’ll never find
Watching his face
Jump on this girl
Take the moon out
Let alone beat it
Locked in my mind
Don't laugh at me
Don't piss me off
Please pass it on
I’m always cold
Say what you want
Because I'm awake
You’re the star
Picture a message
Calling for peace
I’m almost done
Speak like a girl
Your present moon
And then it hurts
The appeal of art
Some mighty names
You’ll be sorry
Freedom from fear
Mistakenly, wrong
Expose each other
You are wondering
Need every stroke
Watching you burn
And in this dream
Watching her fall
Don’t attack me
That sometime ago
A pack in the air
Fly away and soar
Lapping your feet
Blow his head off
All I want is you
Too busy thinking
I took him to war
And at what price
From the spinners
Crashing at night
What will be done
I’m still young
Make yourself sad
I saw you through
To my fourth year
Every time I read
You can have life
The curtain calls
Passed the nation
Reaching the door
It takes him down
Have the strength
The tide is round
Another down year
I’m here to say
It's hard to find
Please support us
Suck my heart out
Fire up your mind
Heart of my heart
It’s bad enough
Kicking the clown
Been up all night
A book of my soul
Slow like a plant
My father left me
An immortal flame
A drug addict kid
And you’re ours
I’ve found life
Emotionally great
When will it end?
To prepare myself
He died a fat man
Put down the dead
Mad and miserable
We can only dream
Overtonight today
No arms are spare
Better than kings
Gonna show it off
The way we belong
Before we started
Inaing indecision
Immediate triumph
Where's the soup?
Freaking the wind
The breeze breaks
Watch as a weapon
Leave a good word
He calls me small
Tried to be trash
Forget your wands
I won't feel good
Let's get to life
You’re not real
About an hour ago
Made me the enemy
What am I to know
Who’s standing?
He’s a lifeline
To have your hand
Swallow the bones
But you’ll show
The obvious truth
Stumbling on sand
Blaming your boss
Too tired to feel
Far in the future
Beyond the street
The moon of truth
You’re floating
You gotta go away
A mental question
Slipping the film
The page of paper
The reason I fell
Accept this favor
We have good eyes
Give you the hook
You have my heart
Like I’m a trap
Fooled or pleased
True in Hollywood
Flying to America
I won’t cry out
Smell the message
Trapped and stuck
See what they say
So beat the train
Just what she got
Trapping together
The pitiful smith
Throw a ball down
A fine instrument
If I die tomorrow
For what’s good
To burn and drown
Before that floor
In such a big way
The midnight love
Morning is coming
A game of mirrors
She’s the lover
When I’m around
That famous shine
We saw him crying
My sorrow changes
I could get tired
I wanna feel okay
Little ironic kid
Walk by my window
Hooligans love me
A star of Babylon
Lost all my nerve
I’m always late
Selling everybody
The guards say no
His false bravado
Sick of your lies
Bad falls in love
Wasn't right here
Something changes
Through the stars
Died for the time
On my mantelpiece
Mistake, mistreat
Heady little kids
I see you instead
Then we both hear
A brighter future
Take no prisoners
The heart of life
What will you do?
You could be mine
Paperback edition
I'd never lose it
I can hold my own
Has to push it in
Love me this much
Search for heaven
Hurt all the time
No more neon cars
Sweet parade past
Moon from the sky
Sit down and sing
Got no known room
The last question
How can you care?
In shackled words
Committed suicide
We’ll be crying
To hide the truth
Lost another girl
I don't like this
Good night to you
Know every stitch
Very strange blue
My pride is built
Open with a smile
Sick of this rush
Don’t waltz out
More than a horse
Blue mountain way
Swipe lefty trick
Playing clockwork
Even as I'm dying
Ragged and savage
When I could live
A sorrowful world
Take to the cross
Walk in the stars
Under the shadows
Live for a moment
Stealing my wings
But you’re mine
Bending the world
Through the ruins
People are waking
On the blind side
Drink their vodka
With their hovels
Learn how to play
Stand your ground
We sold ourselves
Then she’s dead
A universal claim
When we come home
Feel free to cuss
I’m taking over
I do not hate you
It’s ridiculous
Vanished from you
Know not who I am
No one is a guest
You’ve all died
Everything breaks
Kill the memories
The silver lining
Changing the wash
Have some excuses
She’s next door
The midnight show
We’re all lying
He rode all night
But when it rains
Slip my damn face
Rain falling down
I see you alright
Minding his piece
And that darkness
In a foreign land
I will not forget
Still lovin' beer
Don’t look down
Late to the party
Tune in for a run
I found you alive
Money’s no good
If I walked it in
Rather than fight
Join the carnival
Mistakes you make
Hard on your face
A little blue hot
Pictures of faith
New store windows
Seems a good time
Stay away from me
I’m your friend
For all this time
Living under fire
I know everything
Where they belong
Freedom of speech
Waiting for a boy
And I’m in love
Over every avenue
Milk for the eyes
A line of flowers
One last midnight
Pieces of my soul
Just to calm down
Knew he was crazy
A timeless defeat
Now you’re free
Just now and then
The haunted halls
You don't need me
People almost saw
Got lots of money
Lonely and lonely
You didn’t know
Paper butterflies
Death in his form
Where I come from
His arms are warm
And you see a man
Well, John Toques
Pussy in the hood
Alone in a corner
Dance with angels
I can dance naked
Ornery trad songs
Your devil for me
Slip into despair
A lighter no less
In the crossroads
The moon flutters
All night and day
She never gave up
Crude and caustic
And I slept it up
You tried so hard
Real life teacher
It’s about here
Shaking your back
Feel so different
Her miserable cry
Invades the halls
Stone and sawdust
Shadows of infamy
Butts and paninis
Destroying a tune
The moon is black
Poppets’s world
Golden in the sun
Behind the camera
I need the things
V’s still alive
No justice at all
The felling whale
Give me something
A funeral for him
The sun has risen
You’re to blame
As I was thinking
Keep to the shore
Point blank at me
Stranger troubles
He’s good to go
Wiping the leaves
The grass is blue
Build me a bridge
The baby is dying
Eyes on the floor
Down in this park
Sail me back home
Find the children
You were prepared
A colourless idol
Pretty princesses
Carrying the king
That he would die
If we were angels
Sinking unguarded
I’m on the move
Through the dryer
Playing with fire
I’ll never stay
That blew my mind
Here we are laugh
The night is dark
We’re both dead
The time had come
That bum whistles
Through the mouth
As long as I stay
Human intercourse
Human trafficking
The tearful wheel
The truth of life
Here I come again
Displays the veil
Your last feeling
Up to that number
Feeling abandoned
I don’t mind it
First time unpack
If I can keep you
Come on behind me
Instant and dying
Through the walls
Begging for blood
I’m meant to be
You want it crazy
The sweat remains
He’s never gone
Watched you smile
Told in our bones
Your unholy drama
Bless the morning
Ready to be known
Let them find you
To take you apart
Save for a moment
All her illusions
I’ll be able to
My love for music
The sun reflected
Got nothing to do
What matters here
I’m not so sure
Some of you shine
Anything for sale
The frog art book
I’ve seen a boy
Holy virgin ocean
Bring me through
Super-human deal
And you know it?
Through the gate
Love still burns
Dealt your heart
Say all you want
Had to surrender
A habit to exist
Pictures to show
Spring like here
Ready for a wave
Waiting for them
Damaged memories
Love, love, love
Walking on water
Stars rise, fall
Hold your tongue
Some girl dreams
Tomorrow we wake
Tell me my story
You're all alone
Modern telephone
Beautiful to see
Taking on things
Just walk around
Better play dead
Looking over you
Quiet my silence
You’re so free
Rise of the king
I don't know why
The secret sauce
Will do anything
Full of nonsense
And set to dance
Hurt his emotion
Sick with a cold
He’s smart too
Every wound dies
Embrace kindness
All the pictures
I can’t be shy
You’re a voice
No more emotions
To listen to you
For all eternity
Crying all night
Everyone's dying
That falls apart
Dust-filled town
War to slow down
We need you more
Fucking hangover
Accept this door
Little startling
It’s beautiful
Flying past home
Under this curse
Where none stood
She may be empty
We just sold out
Streets of yours
Many a lost look
Let’s say okay
No one is afraid
And I wonder how
Blows your drink
I'm still afraid
Dibbing my heart
I can see it now
Run to your room
Too low for fame
Hold your breath
Some ancient men
Pleasures inside
You made my soup
Living this life
A fleeting scene
The way you talk
Bring me freedom
Time for the sun
Oh, it's amazing
Above a big cell
Buses in the sky
I cannot be seen
Pray for my babe
Through her nose
The season is on
Pass down a clue
Down to our feet
Watch me singing
Back home, there
Seeing her again
Grow some bodies
Climb the ladder
One line of code
O Brother to you
You keep walking
You’re so calm
Gather the truth
Everyone listens
Now come on down
Caught in a trap
Flying a balloon
Love always rest
I am your spirit
Try getting away
It’s a cliché
Broke the bridge
That same spirit
Kiss in my mouth
I will serve you
No new baby name
Where you belong
A sensitive song
Lies in an alley
You took it away
You’ll need me
Do what you must
You’ll love me
Sweeps your skin
Stand against me
Take the rainbow
Explain it to me
And they believe
To hide yourself
Oh, come on soon
Dirty trick king
No longer belong
Who's in the box
The wooden shack
I met his father
My eyes turn red
One of the kings
True and a ghost
We've got a deal
I'm home tonight
Think of another
Back in the game
Can I stay home?
Refine all hopes
Tomorrow is mine
The way you feel
Starving spirits
He comes through
Is this a dream?
Late one evening
In the new space
We've lost a God
Good to sleep in
The thunderstorm
In the same room
Rock up the hill
Talking the talk
So there you are
Please come over
Selfies I'm sure
Always satisfied
A snake of pride
She wasn’t sad
I take your hand
Raise your voice
Fuck that statue
Heart's so sweet
I’m gonna join
I’ll be by you
The only way out
Let it come down
Star wars dreams
Give me a chance
A doorbell rings
All the memories
Every final shot
Dig them back up
Straight to home
An amazing smile
On top of it all
Touch my breasts
Up to their bank
In the test case
Through her mind
Leave it to them
A sister dreamed
All will be fine
It gets you down
Head to the news
Skinny eyed deer
Watching us fall
Come on, come on
I'm fine with it
You are so young
Give it the name
Addicted to love
Took you to hell
As it stands now
Downed the river
Your royal heart
His hand in mine
I’ve done fine
I hate my father
She did you good
The old fountain
The morning star
Some great songs
On your knuckles
A kid on my tomb
I sing the blues
Keeping it quiet
The mountain art
You’re an idol
Just so you know
Your wheels turn
Push that button
You will find me
Our lady goddess
Wish I would die
His guiding hand
It feels so nice
Lying in the sun
Feeling powerful
Let's meet again
With every trick
Under the saddle
Got to finish it
You’re up high
Spread the ashes
Like buried fire
He is the father
Nail the strings
Raining tomorrow
A million people
Through a window
Stare on shadows
Skinny red-faced
Speak your minds
Sweet meets sour
It’s only fair
My ways are open
You’ll be okay
No enemy anymore
She won’t show
My shadow maiden
Can you find me?
This is her life
Hand me a pencil
Now take me back
Your broken back
He can't stop me
Across the water
Against the wall
Yes, the old way
Headlights shine
Naked and lonely
Tears for speech
Mother and lover
But it’s dying
Escape the world
Down to the rest
And no more lies
His turn at last
Intense pleasure
Caught our money
How do you know?
She took a glass
I feel so broken
Paper cigarettes
Love is at stake
Voices within me
To another world
I need your help
The last curtain
All through town
Now live a dream
Shake your chair
We made promises
No waste of time
Meets attraction
Feeling so tired
You’re waiting
Eyes on her lips
It's so heavenly
That's the truth
To stay the same
As I fell asleep
Spinning flowers
Smells like piss
Take it with you
Drive’s filled
Blow your dreams
Put the gun down
Road to paradise
Little red hills
Your voice notes
Crashes his face
Know where to go
Cause this alone
Rolling pictures
Take my mistress
Scour her rubble
Upcoming justice
The golden earth
Still quite rude
My illusions win
Kill the typhoon
Filled with milk
Out in the plain
I care about you
And they tell me
Chasing the moon
Without thinking
Decent way to go
Walked past eyes
Under the shadow
Shut up and move
The beaming moon
Ask that boy why
Feel free to eat
Place in my face
Life on the line
Using your mercy
Two bright years
Build a new life
Seems very weird
Recess and dance
Face in a bottle
Dead men breathe
Who’s a giant?
Like I should be
Find your things
Things seem fine
Paddling outside
The way you come
Can go to heaven
I never knew him
Are you with me?
Our lives turned
Little sensation
Becomes all gone
Learn to survive
Long golden days
Back in the ways
Son of every man
I mean all of us
Dump me’s head
Beyond this poem
Begging for gold
I’m a busybody
Where did you go
In another world
You took control
Used her fingers
Around the clock
Just another day
Search the south
Right now you go
Silverfish waves
Sailboat airfare
Time has run out
With most people
Our youth say no
My baby's broken
Across the ocean
The tears flowed
You are so tired
The pain is over
To live in ruins
Throwing wreaths
Found these bags
Join in my dance
I’m not crying
White pearl tint
Just out of fear
I want you there
Hello for a date
Wall of a bottle
Rock on his head
She’ll not say
Time for the day
Something I hate
Song for a night
The running star
Blow the whistle
Skinny as a whip
I gotta say that
Love is a poison
Hate came my way
Are you so cold?
Supposed to stop
Here's your girl
Touch me, please
Beyond the exile
Everything I got
Come in the wind
It’s cold here
About lost years
My drinking game
Sit for a minute
Money I can take
With our support
Big and powerful
Hey rain on fire
Pull the trigger
My name is tense
Loving a miracle
I will pass away
Forever’s mine
Sounds so simple
You can touch me
The wedding ring
Neon in the acid
Hold it together
Feel bad for her
Dancing together
Across this hill
Yes, yes, please
Say all the time
Storm through me
Enough is enough
Down in the pool
Please have love
Brand new carpet
Dig another hole
The finest ships
A beautiful view
He loves her too
Inside the dream
Sounds like shit
I owe your money
When you're done
Just his friends
And it’s wrong
You will love me
I’m your pride
About equal time
Search for clues
Wearing no shoes
A well-lit place
Try to come back
Leaving me young
You’ll find me
Hello from death
Down in darkness
The English Bird
His name is Anna
My time together
A kindred spirit
Need of a weapon
Chasing interest
You’re like me
Long, thin drift
Lost all control
Over a month old
You’re in love
Burning midnight
Remember my name
Sing in the moon
Painted at night
The Pitiless War
I’m gonna quit
I’m gonna stay
Dirt got cleaned
Singing the song
It’s wonderful
Against all odds
Things you think
Memory it inside
After your death
Saffron blankets
Changing colours
Living in misery
Finds my friends
Jump in the cage
Came on, come on
For my warm call
Sailing by night
Some white shoes
Like the shadows
The game is over
To prove you men
Here's the place
The common enemy
He goes to sleep
The rays of love
Let's be friends
Small fingerwork
Killing rainbows
Star-shaped bowl
Join your sister
Bad as they were
You’re a dream
Fix the darkness
Love the highway
Crap that clings
Just a small fan
Slowing to adore
Soul still alive
He’s all yours
Add your clothes
Tears of silence
Never getting up
Own my own dream
In a lost tongue
Live your dreams
But for a change
Your broomstroke
One summer night
You won’t walk
I do feel better
Trying to bounce
Sweeping thunder
Dirty the powder
Giving it my all
Erased the title
Think of my body
Here we go again
Big lovable face
Water in the sky
It just happened
Sounded like fun
White horse head
The muse’s sun
Sipping a bottle
Run out and hide
Bound to nowhere
Spinning in half
Even if the gave
We are so scared
People wanna fly
Worked like hell
Leave it with me
And in my memory
A bird of terror
He won't be soon
It’s not wrong
Changing my mind
She had no proof
Listen on my ear
Drawing electric
To give a shadow
Night in the sun
Go ahead and run
Can't get enough
On the moonlight
Getting no sleep
Pick your things
It’s fucked up
God is beautiful
Through the haze
Cry in the shade
You don’t know
Low on sweetness
A kite’s wings
Protect her soul
Our baby is fine
I wanna kill you
The wetter shore
Talking of bombs
Me and my island
Here's some news
We are the river
I wanna go alive
I’m an old man
Just be yourself
Down in the room
Chasing you down
V-Day of consent
Someone goes out
The true machine
Head to the room
Talk as a master
Forget that week
Dying only to go
All our feelings
Wonderful prison
Will it kill me?
Don’t trust me
Didn’t mean it
Behind the waves
Shot in the head
The arboreal cat
Her mind is here
More heat please
We landed safely
The way I see it
So you’re free
Through the sand
He’s brilliant
Pouring rainbows
Every day I hide
On getting drunk
Open the canyons
Just look at you
The sky is empty
Dead paper tiger
Out of the weeds
Still wanting me
Mind is a jumble
Paint your brain
All I ever knew
The saddest day
My fine friends
Are you afraid?
Like underwater
Out of the blue
Got little toys
Let's get going
See you tonight
I hear you talk
The stars shake
Bounced in pain
I make mistakes
Waiting to wake
I'm coming home
Across the town
Put a door open
A white chicken
Leave them cold
Spread the love
Goes on my mind
Work up tonight
They understand
Some shady eyes
To spare my son
Imagine my eyes
Crying too loud
Miss your words
First he saw me
You’re my man
For some reason
Move the target
Time to be good
Wanting to play
How it’s done
When you see me
So in your mind
Make me believe
Turned to steam
Battering glass
And let me know
A flaming shark
I’m not crazy
More of a drain
Let him be king
Put in my crown
Sold me so much
Don't force you
As a reflection
I'll understand
The way to soul
The snow moving
He's not afraid
My fucking face
The day is over
Your golden age
Don’t mind me
Swear to a girl
I’m the devil
No speech today
The fabled hero
Sell the dishes
She finally did
If he ever flew
The waters call
Among the stars
Back on the run
I lost my sight
Catch your hand
Hear the sounds
New world order
My sister and I
I kept going up
Never wear down
That new collar
Darkest journey
Some new dreams
Shoulda used me
Be free to ride
Let’s stop it
Burn down doors
Enclosing doors
Like a mistress
Out in the open
Never sleepwalk
Lead by a light
Streets of city
I will keep you
Tears of sorrow
Make no mistake
Head over heels
Move this thing
Visions of ruin
Love reminds me
Nothing earthly
From inside out
The living room
To turn me away
Night after day
I saw my mother
Join me tonight
Don’t be king
Won't nobody go
I’m locked up
The best things
This tired show
Silver standard
Run you through
Match your mind
Look at my feet
A small rainbow
That won't work
Walking as fuck
Comin' together
Lights down now
Always changing
We had a shadow
Well done today
Can I help you?
It’s a corner
Your trash talk
Let us all rise
My holy friends
We’ll all cry
Between my eyes
Open the window
It’s too late
Just after noon
Crossing a line
Some down below
Time slips away
These past days
The key to time
Son of a slayer
When she smiles
Headed the bank
No belief in it
He only a dream
Coming here now
Verbal violence
From your mouth
Sooner or later
My body changes
My own business
No real sparkle
Some sweet song
Distant thought
From this place
Afraid of light
What did I say?
A man can dance
A haunting look
I take you down
Speak the truth
Sweet pleasures
Now is the time
Swift and round
I’m gonna die
Took it too far
Sitting in jail
She opened fire
What he will do
You’re a weed
The stars shout
I just love you
Go to his place
The world's way
No man knows it
Beat a big time
Caught the fire
My bones buried
Destroy my soul
Painful rhythms
Take a lifetime
So what you say
An angel of God
I see you shine
Blow by the sea
Alone in a room
Me and my voice
Fantastic world
Disillusionment
Never look down
And I know that
Inside my heart
With a headache
Give money away
Modern daylight
Do what you can
Help me get out
Just a blue sky
A place to hide
Did I hurt you?
Anyone knows me
Real happy time
To sleep safely
You look strong
No broken bones
Beat your wheel
Holds them down
A rock star now
Life is a trick
The fuel inside
We’re outside
The golden test
Your white hair
Place of hatred
From the depths
It’s a prison
Peacock fishing
Just get me out
This time today
To cry the song
I’ll lose you
Everyone I know
Should you cry?
How do you say?
Aired on a mist
Talk the gutter
Beyond a shadow
Shut your doors
Excessive force
You look so sad
Cover the frame
Our hearts know
Far from adrift
While in prison
Up for anything
Hear her scream
He dies for you
Under the stage
You keep crying
Never goes away
A worthless rag
You seem so new
Incentive shows
Like the future
Without the sun
Shiver red hair
With clear eyes
Turned me round
How you’ll be
Make up a story
Waking up drunk
Absolutely true
Got everything?
Sweet white sun
Slow as a snail
Drawn my senses
Narrow the jaws
Push me through
Shut your mouth
With your money
Drawn a picture
My life is good
The big picture
Around the town
Cover your ears
Rude white tent
Intense emotion
Go by my memory
Click on a wall
And if you were
Do you need it?
Cover your eyes
Elevate a stage
Falling in love
Brand new blood
Until last time
No changes made
Into the jungle
Perfect knowing
Turn inside out
That's not fair
Nowhere to hide
Soul Encryption
Back in the day
Begging for him
Of fucking time
Watcher of life
Bring it for me
Forever will be
Die more slowly
Called for help
Sealed on rocks
At the best job
That's my house
Cominning-glass
Go head to head
Called her name
Touch your skin
A summerie doll
Too many people
Wonderful stage
The black space
Took care of me
And then I died
To think of you
A train of fire
Ousiss the days
Look out for me
You’re inside
Obsolete canvas
That damn devil
Here I go again
We've left here
Love reminds us
Hello real life
In the high air
Wherein I hide?
Into this world
Grab your heart
Stupid old fool
Run on the moon
Don’t hurt me
I’m locked in
Every bit of it
Broken stetship
And now you are
An untold story
Have got a plan
Cover the storm
Got a free ring
Severely fucked
The broken laws
Deep within you
Every time I do
Reminds you why
In your stomach
I’ll find out
Burn the papers
Next to nothing
Through my soul
Rock up the sky
Took my picture
Nothing to lose
Caught on video
Meet the ghosts
Such a sad mood
Tell your story
To almost smile
Remembering who
High and mighty
Full of passion
The statue wall
Nothing so true
Colors changing
Tears just flow
Tired of it all
Darkness inside
Bodies run high
Floating island
I’m impatient
Keep on running
Got hold of him
I’ll find you
An order to you
Now hear me out
The coldest day
Mister me today
We laid flowers
Pick up a woman
Reading my lips
Distant I guess
What you expect
Where's my ass?
Live in harmony
Come on sweetie
He wasn't a cop
Cleaned up shit
Things I missed
Above your hour
With her shadow
Unwrap the fire
The way we know
The sewer dream
The rule of law
My broken heart
Got on his face
Dismembering me
I saw the world
As we have died
The dead priest
Smoking my song
The hollow door
Comrade sheriff
The way to love
Love is my life
I will be sorry
He made me sick
I'll go outside
Taking her away
The warm season
These dogs bark
Can't get upset
Oh, hello night
Damaged friends
And ask me that
The stars dance
I saw a sunrise
Hurt my brother
That it is true
My smell swells
Pulling through
Sunlit jailbird
Bad to the soul
I won’t touch
I walk past you
Open your heart
Strayed in time
White is broken
Your dirty mind
Spread my wings
Love and danger
We come so late
These dead ends
Sympathetic boy
The green earth
My tender earth
In your sadness
Gave up already
You’re insane
Like holy water
Low lying noise
Back up to hide
Catch your face
And smile again
I can't help it
Desperate times
The green glows
Death by chance
The sunken tomb
Here in my side
Love's onto you
Exclaim the sky
What can I say?
It’s half men
In the sunlight
God damn things
Sweet and sweet
You must belong
Let's get there
Our tongues fly
To pass my mind
Open your mouth
The truth comes
Lost a thousand
But you’ll go
In the hospital
I’ll be sober
No shame on you
Lean for a walk
Son of this day
Turning me down
What is a trick
A scene of fear
Find him pretty
His main feeder
Two big worries
This is destiny
Leave her alone
Hit me up again
Change the eyes
Change the past
Leave him alone
For live silver
Love your heart
She’s for you
You can't be me
Fly in one band
She kept crying
Forever running
The star is set
Do you know me?
It's never good
See your secret
On the way home
Down with abuse
You’re afraid
I can’t watch
But look at you
Misplaced money
Our worst enemy
A place in hell
My heart I know
Just for a name
Sun from behind
Buried treasure
May God help me
It’s my dream
Perfect old man
Falling for you
When others cry
End the mission
I’ll be a pig
Don’t grow up
Died of a wound
The crime scene
Rolling my eyes
This isn't work
Dance and dance
A glass of wine
Red roses bloom
I know she said
In a clear room
Satisfy my soul
She won’t lie
War on the wall
Gave every move
What men can do
Live like fools
Hidden too hard
When fate kills
Here in my city
Tried to relate
Smells of smoke
Behind the pipe
Jumped too high
Those two words
Morning of love
So he’s young
You’re crying
Start some over
Feel free to go
New plain image
Watching for me
With it for you
Hot master fuck
Isn't it black?
Let him see why
Ridden the road
The love you do
Go throw it off
Join the battle
Drink the water
Burned rainbows
That dark place
That I'm afraid
Murder a friend
I wanted to cry
Check the rules
Roams the halls
Starving dreams
Kissed my heart
Glamorous looks
Got it together
They thought so
Never surrender
Above the times
A place to rest
Till I’m dead
Getting nervous
Hard on my head
Can you see it?
And yes, I know
Longtime enemy
Dead after all
Before he died
Take the wheel
Wished for God
To her ecstasy
Why am I here?
Deaf heartsets
Sounds strange
Just a thought
You will do so
Fire and anger
The dry muscle
Can't face you
Rather be here
Born to wander
Smelling water
Morning clouds
Burning inside
He’s a shark
Hear me scream
Your holy name
Rides his past
Meet the Queen
Lost innocence
What’s wrong
Halt the world
I’ve met you
He's inside me
I was of glass
Heavy pressure
Raise the wind
To run so fast
People flatter
Shake and weep
Since the dawn
The final boss
Don't touch it
Take a comfort
He sits in awe
Just moving in
Rather at ease
Gave it my all
Make me forget
Made of powder
I still got it
I can lay back
Get on my wife
Hands on walls
It’s illegal
Are you crazy?
If we used her
A gilded story
Happy tomorrow
I’ll be cool
Had no windows
Begin to sleep
Eyes of ravens
I like it cold
Hello everyone
This full stop
Sing the music
Going into war
I was one time
Why I hate you
The pretty way
I wonder what?
No time to cry
He put it away
A fine trinity
It was so true
The palms down
She wanted him
Come on pupils
Pay it forward
Hide your soul
Ready to dance
Good at things
Hello universe
You never know
What about you
Everybody says
Blue and white
You live alone
How easy it is
Man-made chaos
Save the world
Take every bit
Flashs of hell
All that stuff
A girl's voice
Get in my mind
Walls too high
Blow our minds
My mother died
Feeling pretty
Save your mind
Until tomorrow
You look tired
Give the label
Because of you
Enough of fame
Talk the truth
Sick as a sack
Life in terror
Son of the son
Out of nowhere
Black or white
Cut me a train
Breathe it out
Broke past you
A man of steel
Heaven for her
Everyone knows
You see me now
No longer know
The centreline
Blood in veins
Brought you on
I'm outta here
Talk for years
Poor situation
The sun smiles
Deep white sea
Pretend I feel
Down in winter
Live your life
Self-conscious
Sell the title
Let it be here
I love you too
But then again
Thinking-glass
The time flies
No good to see
I am a big fan
Bring her down
To be a cliche
Friends I held
No love on ice
A glass of red
Me neither yet
About my music
Future cargoes
Should've done
Run in circles
He wakes me up
You’re alone
I’ll be sick
Some dead girl
Give them time
Looking for me
The junkie bum
Son of a bitch
Where are you?
The love-maker
Full of sorrow
What you dream
No matter what
Come on ladies
Broom together
Burn my memory
And yet I know
A wave of love
Too much money
All too strong
Lovely gunboat
I looked it up
Same old shame
So much of him
You’re in me
A thief's play
My little work
Totally ornery
Hold your seat
Too much to do
Mouth to mouth
Under the skin
Make it better
You look ready
Gave me my arm
Within a month
May fall apart
Raining clouds
Your lips hurt
Bring me notes
Just keep away
Leave to dance
Have loved you
One last thing
Don’t forget
Going to watch
I just met her
With God there
Put off crying
Gonna kill you
Eternal sunset
On the catwalk
Dream together
Poetry on fire
Out here today
I can help you
Play the catch
Bright fingers
The bells ring
Let's go dance
Find the truth
Like a phoenix
Hey look at me
A lake of fire
Modern slavery
Perfect solace
I keep growing
Lost the stars
Song for a boy
Shocker dreams
I won’t tell
Who’s right?
A loose stitch
Out of harmony
Sick and angry
Blowing us out
Unsold secrets
Tell all of us
Strike a nerve
Take your soul
Selling it all
Sweet and cold
It’s an idol
Ride the ocean
Made a bargain
Money is awful
Sweet to waste
Rhyme glistens
On the highway
Light, and low
Far enough now
It ain't wrong
Hey look at it
She’s pretty
I'm not crying
And here it is
Won’t forget
I’m very sad
Hold your hand
I’ll be okay
Join the dance
Spinning stars
Coloring there
Stop and stare
Fallen in love
Smell my blood
They made love
Low paying job
A shot through
Let me go wild
Broke the door
In the present
To take a leap
Inside the box
Move your feet
Sell our souls
Stay around me
We created him
The walls shut
Suffering pain
Take your time
Keeps you free
Hey, nice view
Looks like you
Through a vein
Give me my gun
What about me?
A scarlet kiss
Nothing for me
Ask the others
Talking to her
Goodbye winter
I’m the same
You keep dying
Hang it around
For three days
Got no trouble
Jesus would go
Rain and shine
Different love
On my doorstep
Calling for it
Tonight I love
Where the moon
Things we knew
To come to you
High above all
I grew too old
The call's out
Money’s seen
I see no enemy
Your ears call
Leave it there
Blackbird blue
Is it for you?
Took advantage
Laugh and roll
Curtain spouts
Snakes breathe
When I met you
Her custom guy
Across a river
Too much honey
More bear song
I am wondering
Same boat song
Happy drinking
It’s so easy
Made fun of me
Paint me black
So clearly out
Save your life
With low hopes
Do you see me?
Drop the Candy
I feel scarred
It’s just me
Like a miracle
Here she comes
Talking to him
Back my dreams
I use my voice
Know who cares
I use a coffin
Leaves the cut
Taking comfort
A scarlet mess
I died for you
Preying on you
In the evening
Pits of living
Many years ago
I don’t know
Do it together
Blood and lava
I did say that
More than toys
All you can do
All the losers
All your suits
It's the Devil
Crying in fear
I got it going
By killing you
That other day
To sow sorrows
All the praise
I didn't dance
To be an angel
Let a day pass
Long time same
The bleak hole
No no one else
Kinda suicidal
The safe place
Killing a boat
We'll find him
Bottle of soul
You never knew
Eyes wide open
My first dream
Set fire to me
To destroy you
Give up dreams
Bodies of love
Shush the skin
A lovable shit
Found paradise
Taking my ride
Crying my name
Run like a man
Exorcise death
Want the words
Stoned to hell
My hero is God
I will be fine
Then why wait?
I am not happy
Cry as I dance
A smiling baby
All times long
Great thoughts
Bastard at all
The other side
Sick of it all
Born in dreams
Water and mist
My way, go, go
World and race
Come inside me
To pack you in
The simple way
All men can do
Broke the lock
Playing tricks
Many are brave
Knock on doors
Talking freely
His dark guilt
Soak it inside
Say yes to her
Headfirst here
A mellow voice
Into the truth
Dust the earth
Let me try out
A brother room
Drop dead slow
Dance of horns
Across the sea
The photo kill
Fly on the sky
Getting hungry
The past tense
See on my face
All day you go
End of process
Ask her, when?
Far to go dead
Lie in silence
Kill her words
Voting for oil
For the infamy
The new shreds
Feeling chills
Life was there
And they go by
In his passing
It’s a crime
Close the book
Dirt from home
Going all over
To the extreme
Hooked in love
You ain't free
Pray to heaven
Bound to decay
Crumbling down
The grass seed
Free your soul
All I need now
Pull me to you
All your scars
Till you shake
Lie is a curse
Two footprints
I have a crush
Your sad shell
Stray to Paris
How could you?
My art gallery
Out of control
May be a prize
Becoming a man
Another battle
With blue eyes
A torch is lit
No more angels
Only fade away
Roast the game
Covered in mud
The fourth god
Under the tree
Save your soul
My destination
Infiltrate you
His naked body
We start again
I'm so worried
The bell rings
Iron and steel
The rain falls
Oh my goodness
Prey on people
Glowing sparks
The rain stops
I’ll move on
Broke my heart
You’re crazy
The pipe dream
Place of power
Watching music
As if they saw
Into the chaos
Don’t let up
Suddenly awake
Wear your soul
One fell sword
It's cold here
Money for fame
Looking inside
Cry to the cop
Sick and sober
To free myself
I just get why
Yeah this time
Sail that ship
Tell me a poem
They won't pay
A game changer
Two blows out
I will return
And stay away
No foundation
Right back up
Inside of you
It’s unmade
Bring it down
Lord of paint
No other time
No one around
Into the dark
A silver star
Hear me shout
Stars on fire
Close my eyes
Lights for me
Tears of hope
Pimp my words
I had to know
A proud rhyme
A way of life
A newborn son
Poured up him
Clear my mind
Here he comes
Lost them all
A cage window
This language
Come and show
Burn the hole
Love for life
Over the road
Stand in line
You’re dead
Those who lie
What they say
Bitter as ice
Lines blurred
How is my day
She's alright
Only to dream
Inside I fear
Drifting mind
Move up to me
She’s lying
To be in love
A weird crowd
Down the ages
Silver bullet
In your youth
Suddenly gone
Checking down
A new kingdom
On the street
Mouth opening
The other day
Brain me hard
Just the gate
Feed the king
Hoping to die
Midnight dawn
I got a gourd
Took no break
Let us follow
Iron hand now
New York City
Your old life
Like no other
Day after day
How I see you
Yeah, I guess
Life or death
He cut inside
And who knew?
The thin line
A part of you
Don’t laugh
A gentle wind
It's over now
Lord of years
Love me a bit
Fly him along
Never mind me
Knock it dead
Cry all right
An old friend
Did you know?
With her eyes
All this time
Keep his cool
Disapprove me
Lucky in need
Like the king
Say it anyway
For the world
Sitting awake
Nowhere, here
Watch my face
Turning it on
Where we live
The square me
Pray your sky
Had no father
In the ground
Don’t sleep
Down the road
White bubbles
Thunderstruck
Hang on to me
I'll miss you
I feel fucked
He doesze off
Find a prince
Take him down
Do the dishes
Come together
Make us laugh
Clear line up
Back to sleep
A flying tram
I like it too
Long and dead
Our eyes burn
Abandoned pet
Repossessions
Tears of pain
And now I see
On the bridge
Brought chaos
What I can do
To bring love
Stop and spin
The wet dream
Anybody knows
I had met him
I take a fall
Into the glow
Drop our love
Put it to use
In a big room
Still alright
Talking glass
Dancing below
Stop cringing
Want me naked
Breathe quick
Let's do that
All around me
Locked my bed
We grew apart
The limelight
Time to smile
Won't go away
Hard to leave
Bling my eyes
Lost my faith
All the evils
Making a pyre
On a moon day
It’s an act
Wild and wild
Set the image
If we all die
Come on honey
It’s a duel
The rings out
Crooked tramp
Bouncing kite
A vacant part
In your heart
Dancing alive
For with love
One last time
Through a gap
To pull it up
Meet the boss
Son of slaves
All I can say
Kill the dude
Lonely souls?
To you and me
Droping bells
The end times
I’m at home
Little sister
They hate you
At a mealtime
Drive me back
I'll kill you
Night and day
Not right now
Are you here?
Warm memories
Fire and fury
Fireflies fly
Snowy picture
How you spoke
Dream is over
Don't lose me
It’s my son
Free and free
You’re mine
Make it sweet
Here's to you
My first kiss
When it rains
Speed is high
The word wins
Down with sun
This is my me
I walked away
Golden towers
Clear the sky
It’s boring
He rides away
In my opinion
Like tomorrow
This new flag
Time to dance
All right now
To burn by me
Life is small
A tree I ride
Sick at heart
Make me crazy
Say so little
Flying dreams
Wall of death
The lights up
Love the book
If anyone did
You know what
In true dance
Ashes my soul
He’s around
Ride that bus
Didn’t know
That was true
White as silk
Just after me
Broken chords
Good mornings
They need you
Speak plainly
Burn to ashes
I will be you
In your place
Neon sneakers
Didn't change
Plastic spoon
Hello darling
But here I am
My first love
In the fields
Trying to lie
To stay alive
Sipping blood
Stealing time
Long daylight
Lost the line
Lucky for you
Another trick
The last line
Hold it close
Made of steel
Join me today
The blue park
A lethal mist
Rest in peace
Let's face it
He’s broken
Give it to me
On my way out
Downright fun
Slow in order
I am here now
Go down again
Easy to reach
We made money
Take the heat
Take my place
Bring me down
We got people
In the street
Disappoint me
Save me alone
To break free
Sign my drink
Where to sing
Love is funny
Anybody else?
A nice flower
Raging my way
Straight away
Cast a shadow
Take the leap
Wherever I go
Master, crazy
Like an angel
Die before me
Drinking here
That new hope
Rock in a box
Saw her touch
With your sky
Jet fish eyes
And the fear?
Calm down now
Without bells
Push the drum
And I see you
We saw it all
Now with them
Grown up fast
It’s a girl
You’re ugly
Time to grind
Dead or alive
Explain to us
Take my wheel
Kill the bird
Raise a storm
The lone word
Made up tales
To come to me
Feel the line
Old love life
Wet dream day
You stay away
Hate up on me
Saw the light
Burn her fire
Born to do it
We both share
Ever got lost
The jazz mood
Another story
The emptiness
Inside a moth
I wasn't dead
Wash the ship
A friend died
The lost road
Rose slippers
Disguised him
I’m leaving
My eyes shine
Hang in there
The safe zone
Falling apart
Fallen angels
Road to class
In every pose
Gave me grief
Hold my hands
My own voices
Yeah, alright
Your next job
Just teach me
Still in love
Life-changing
He died young
Sunshine town
Hungry Sunday
Keep me still
A meteor ride
For a present
Told to share
I feel rotten
While we wait
Lost the hope
Man next door
Full of waste
And you laugh
In the depths
Just share it
See how high?
That you know
Music to them
About the law
Perfect shake
To move there
Realising why
One new thing
Sick and cold
Anything goes
Flying bridge
Pretty skinny
Far from free
I wonder how?
From my heart
Hard and slow
Keep doing it
I believe you
You’re fine
You’re weak
Roll and toss
Confrontation
Up in the sky
Grab a square
The ring road
No different
And the room
I will shake
Common cause
Here to stay
Do you care?
That’s why
I’m pretty
Run past her
Point at you
Seen the way
Third window
In his anger
Just for fun
I'm so sorry
Where I stay
Turn me back
My tracksuit
Set you free
In your mind
Made me feel
Good morning
Give me time
Let your pet
A dark heart
The watchman
On the shore
To guide you
A goal-maker
Reading here
I’m lonely
Life is fine
Dirty dishes
Go back home
Heart bleeds
We feel good
All new toys
Out at night
I never know
As the devil
On the spine
Glowing mist
With purpose
Broken souls
Do something
New timezone
It's all you
Lies my mind
Nose to roof
The end game
We’ll ride
Sixty shades
First of all
Or destroyed
Reaching out
Climb a wall
Burn my mind
Lord of rage
Take control
Crying pills
Got a vision
Going for it
Made to move
Blood for me
Such a shame
Going to die
My caretaker
Things to do
Not for real
The sunrises
Call me home
Distractions
Join with me
A ghost town
One bad mime
A dying star
Evil feeling
We should go
Love of pain
I’m scared
The rich kid
That sad you
Into silence
Like an idol
Resurrection
Cool sailing
You all know
These dreams
Painful time
I can't move
The blue sky
Crude inside
Out of reach
I'm so wrong
All I can do
Stay near me
Full of life
With my mind
Time to sing
Till you die
In our shame
More quickly
It’s awful
Great butler
Blow my nose
She is right
A warm dream
Passing time
Merry spoons
She feeds me
Memories fly
What's next?
Don’t care
She will see
Had the edge
On the fence
Come on over
Ring of fire
Memory blown
Broken Heart
I won’t go
Totally cool
Smell, taste
Escape-scene
Nowhere near
Like bandits
I’m a hero
Pretty bitch
All business
Close-up art
Scarlet eyes
By the waves
Love of mine
A good scene
Falling rain
Feel at home
All day long
Raining down
I feel alive
At the start
She did well
Lady someday
Sail the sky
Dream it out
Won’t look
Long noonday
Got her love
Full of shit
When they do
All they say
Jesus Christ
And two laws
He’s alive
You're a bar
Yes, we will
Wipe you dry
No apologies
Yellow snout
Eat me alive
Call to arms
And I’m up
Careless heh
Rather tease
To tempt you
Just like me
Make me glad
Come on, boy
A-going-down
Open my eyes
In this room
The old ways
Fists of hay
Looking down
Lead me home
The pig here
At that time
Heading away
Take us down
Turning blue
Never smiled
Very violent
Love is dead
A lonely way
Of all times
Doppelganger
Born to kill
More to come
Like he said
Every minute
On your side
Made you cry
Makeup white
Own the soul
Fake stories
Makes me sad
It is broken
While crying
Don’t stay
And you know
Where I live
Up the route
Another time
Vain to lose
Take it away
Nobody cares
Meet the sun
I keep going
City control
You know why
I missed you
Go to heaven
Memory aches
A lonely bag
Good heavens
If the cloud
Can you see?
Calm the sky
The everyman
The two ways
Lying silent
Move the men
Alone in awe
Used a spoon
Fly to stars
Out of style
To get close
Wash it away
Blue dresses
It's so hard
Here you are
Or something
Save my life
Little brain
I think I am
Still strive
Call me weak
I should try
Smashed eyes
A human hand
Sitting down
Falling down
Just to tell
See you soon
Go on a date
Getting laid
So I thought
Live for him
Oh, they won
Your success
Perfect plan
Literal shit
Feeling sick
Son of honey
We are yours
As you sleep
Bloodletting
Good for you
In it I came
Check it out
Walk with me
Lie so tight
Long overdue
I'm a savior
God damn you
It's obvious
Come on down
Life is safe
For his sins
Call me cool
Quiet places
My true love
He got crazy
Rolling fire
White things
And you left
Take me down
Flying vinyl
Take it easy
Hit the wall
Freedom room
Cry Caroline
Sick as hell
Throughneath
My old alarm
You are okay
Like a dream
The only way
Let her sing
To the least
Black Dahlia
The wildsman
A truer word
Wall by wall
Falling over
A fine dress
I’m inside
Scam for you
Grow up here
A part of me
Woolly whale
Common enemy
Like you all
That brother
Road to hell
Nothing more
Feeling away
Your support
Dilemma here
I believe it
For the tips
He knows who
Born to find
In jail cell
Say it to me
Take me away
Just for you
Cried before
He was right
Sick of that
Come to ruin
I wonder why
Spooky horse
With a smile
Over my body
Dawning news
Plastic toys
Walking away
Black hoodie
Taking notes
All the laws
Just a dream
Fall in love
Turn and run
Brings shame
He loved you
At all times
The boy love
Slow it down
All my tears
Be too young
A dying soul
Lovely times
Merry chimes
Fly by force
In isolation
Make it neat
Shadow shift
Found a roof
My apologies
Well my pity
Running away
On in black
Impress her
Ask anybody
Old Alabama
Time passes
A wine vase
I will feel
Pretty cool
The freedom
Set me free
Deep inside
Let us know
Fresh juice
Now find me
Examine you
We can sing
Let it down
A fine hill
Five to one
In the gate
Down by law
Slow motion
Feeling sad
Going crazy
Lost in you
My daughter
To be quiet
Both of you
I’m a boy
Tears apart
Heavy armor
Walk around
Letting fly
In the book
In his rage
In darkness
Look around
Im with you
In my shoes
Confessions
It’s fine
Hey go away
Here she is
I find love
A warm wall
Lonely face
Colors fade
Wake up now
Green waves
More energy
One morning
A butterfly
Take a line
Haunting me
Green light
Got past it
Silver hair
Stiff walls
I am strong
Gimme candy
As you wake
The romance
I’m blind
Have a soul
Stupid mama
Lips of war
Little idol
The bad boy
A punchline
A city town
Dark themes
The seagull
Silent Hour
No surprise
A big smile
Whoopee now
An eternity
For the man
Why must I?
Turn around
If you have
I feel free
Sunbeam sky
Deceive you
For my part
Call me new
Lowest room
To the west
Behind them
Lucky charm
Where we go
New country
Dream of me
One example
Really cool
I wanna see
Don’t die
I sat alone
A planewalk
In the snow
A baby face
As it rains
Seventh sun
Speed me up
To find you
Getting old
Out of love
The absence
By the hand
Like a girl
Like I said
In a bubble
To the moon
Speak of me
Not you yet
Greeting me
Sweet voice
Bound apart
So far away
Holy chance
It’s okay
Say my name
Always sigh
The unknown
Dainty game
I went down
Like dreams
I’m weary
Left of you
My earpiece
That to you
A new world
Water falls
I’m alone
Rock you up
Got no show
Here I come
A key chord
I feel down
Reaching me
The prelude
End my life
Moving slow
From now on
Unlike life
Modern kiss
Stare at me
Without God
Violent act
Flash light
And we knew
And for you
Ride a mite
Wet o' dust
I feel sick
Big picture
Dying alone
Speed miles
Is he free?
Hurt a girl
Dirt tracks
Every thing
They see me
Great house
So long ago
Grown apart
I loved you
Crude price
I went home
Chasing you
Lay the bag
One ballcap
Your choice
Just I know
I'm a shame
Young chums
Scaled down
Had a dream
What I know
Kissing sky
In the dark
Going south
Every penny
Becomes hot
Little girl
But the sky
Silence now
Great scale
You lost us
Time passed
For nothing
Keep inside
Burning sun
Great songs
Watching TV
Come for me
Run me over
You told me
Up and down
Hear me say
We are gone
With a grin
I’ll pass
Would I lie
In my dream
So let's go
Pray for us
Far from it
Just saying
Still gourd
I’m tired
He’ll fly
Piss me off
Big mistake
Like always
Good to see
Love my kid
Aye to hell
I feel good
Fake things
Making love
I know that
Sweet smile
Stand by me
No damn job
Jump for it
Very tender
Way up here
In the band
Yeah you go
Out of fear
Little evil
Let me stop
Dirty guest
Say goodbye
The anarchy
Shake it up
I’m happy
It’s true
I’m stuck
Ragged feet
Down a path
Return home
But why not
Lost - lost
We just met
Then I knew
Great Light
Born strong
Inspire you
On the roof
If you wish
I am inside
You're mine
Your friend
Come on you
Sleepy time
A busy time
Is that it?
Don’t cry
What I need
Two colours
Black strap
Come and go
Alive today
I’m wrong
I’m alive
Hit a saint
Bad brother
Resting low
Say no more
Four planes
Without him
You get low
No weakness
I’m young
Dead on end
In the room
She'll lead
Hear me out
Speak to me
Pray for me
Green walls
Another fan
Here we are
I was right
Disappeared
Cut-off end
Up and out
True truth
Over there
I want you
No brainer
I need you
Now I know
He said no
That movie
I know now
Time to go
Blue earth
Sick of me
How I ride
Open a gun
Very funny
Crucify it
Nude flies
We all die
Mind uself
Blown away
Love hurts
A bad kiss
The groans
Just known
Sweet kids
Till I end
You are me
Open mouth
Killing me
Very scary
Waterfalls
To cry out
In my head
In the fog
A sad time
Flying low
Losing him
Blue gills
Speak soon
The sunset
No, no, no
A nice job
Act matter
Split lips
To be lazy
Rock calls
Dumb music
White hand
Holy trick
Ever sorry
Till I die
In my care
Can't hide
It is over
Excuse me?
With a dog
Revocation
Grows away
Day passes
Behind you
Reminisces
Going home
Half empty
Blood moon
Your habit
Understood
First time
A lost age
Like magic
Dark smoke
His office
Reparation
Let it out
In a dream
Be in love
Who cares?
Lost there
Good night
Snowy blue
Love sells
Sweet lips
New horses
Keep going
To a devil
Great game
Real crazy
King blows
Sign me in
On the run
Empty evil
Come on in
I miss you
I guess so
Can I see?
I could go
Come at me
Lose faith
In my ways
Bloodlines
Got a sign
Absolutely
Here we go
On the bus
I will see
Honey, yes
New planes
I’m torn
Wake me up
I am awake
I’m home
To be free
Her beauty
No emotion
Yeah, okay
Bewildered
I tell you
Never feel
Jesus said
I’m mine
All of you
Noisy love
Cold steel
Deep sleep
Act of war
Green fire
That night
A sea wave
Gentlemens
On my mind
Im a idiot
What a lie
Burn again
My sadness
No shelter
Without us
No address
Every time
Hard times
What we do
Sad to see
More clues
Now so hot
I took you
I’m here
In a flash
I fear not
To see you
The vision
With a boy
Move aside
The gutter
Felt ready
Like china
To grow up
Born again
Chasing me
Other song
Hook it up
Lost it up
My darling
Blood star
My harmony
I'm a bird
No problem
I love him
Like I say
Make noise
All I know
In a hurry
Young cats
Let me die
Lady sings
I'm on top
I'm hungry
Shut me in
Lean on me
Tell me so
Bones sway
All around
Her throne
Heart here
Distortion
That floor
Half blind
Going wild
Back again
This alone
When I sat
And listen
Going down
Up in hell
Great pair
He told me
Crying now
Yes, right
People lie
Evil Angel
Felt wrong
Between us
A screamer
Behind him
This table
The voices
Scary time
With peace
Very tired
Big secret
In her way
See inside
Long alone
No way out
Wintertime
Clear hair
In and out
Lit it off
Son of sin
The future
I’m fine
Dark rain
Stay home
Find time
Just mine
Some show
Unfailing
What now?
Every day
Real life
The truth
One shirt
Dead bird
Sculpture
A rabbit?
Your soul
Every gun
Can't cry
About her
Too early
Last fall
Poor soul
Fly again
Each song
Good girl
Hand laid
The mayor
Your blue
Starlight
Waking up
Emptiness
Fix it up
Holy shit
I'm sorry
Foundling
Open mind
Fools you
Nevermore
Just fine
The curse
A promise
Time away
Blows out
In heaven
Found you
Here I am
Got ideas
O 'em all
This game
Goodnight
My giggle
Up to now
With luck
Our story
An ending
Lost life
I’m old
No regret
I hate it
Oh my god
Of Angels
Give-tale
The decay
Fly blind
They wave
All right
For a day
And again
The widow
Over time
True doge
Memory...
Get a tan
Let me be
This town
A big jam
No solace
In white?
Take hold
Slip Away
Foundered
And today
Far apart
My heaven
Down here
Change me
Dry spell
That game
Big bitch
Thank you
Lucky you
Iron food
Got a lie
Or scared
Blame you
Lucky guy
Let us be
Ten grand
From hell
Uninvited
Hound her
Let it be
Cute dust
Dying now
Got a tan
Miss you?
Blood row
Screw you
Your eyes
The Bible
Let me go
Not a cop
Slip down
I love it
I'm lying
Same deal
Uggshells
That lead
The dream
Two rings
This baby
Calm down
Well done
No danger
A miracle
Undertale
Fall down
One night
Hey angel
Fades out
Be gentle
Until now
Like shit
Hey daddy
Come late
It's mine
Stroll in
Whitebird
Confusion
Stay warm
We go, go
Go inside
Drop down
Yesterday
Run round
Blue mist
Man's way
Here I go
Locked in
Feel free
Everytime
Very well
Afterward
I'm dying
Too heavy
Very fine
Woe is me
Ugly look
Hey momma
On my eye
To get up
I'm tired
Get angry
A balance
Goes easy
Real busy
Never do
New flag
I'm free
Hot lips
Entitled
For once
Hang on!
Overkill
Run away
Me alone
The cake
Enablers
Homeward
Hideaway
Fireball
In ruins
You see?
My place
Reassure
Not done
Made out
Catch up
Stairway
Touch me
Of what?
Overview
Hey babe
Lay down
Climb up
Dreaming
My world
Grow old
Lay dead
At peace
Vanished
Freaking
Painwave
The star
A sleaze
Just you
Invented
Two laws
Dropping
Chump me
To argue
An enemy
Holy gun
New toys
Rose red
Paint me
Till now
Complete
Blushing
At first
My verse
Her body
Hurt you
Upstairs
A vision
Tomorrow
A shield
All over
In tears
In glory
No shame
Preacher
Flailing
Suddenly
Wound up
Her band
I get it
Vomit me
Bad luck
Rainbows
Red talk
Cover me
In there
Sweep me
No doubt
Make way
Hey Mama
New hope
The moon
For ages
One sigh
Let's go
Fly away
The band
Confused
Exorcism
My years
Bragging
Blue sky
Man down
Come on!
Got paid
In truth
True God
Drop off
Bullying
Stranger
Two bars
Betrayal
No as in
Worn out
No ideas
Immortal
So what?
All love
I'm away
Brother
Warning
On fire
Got hit
A crown
At home
Sinking
My mama
No deal
My hand
My stay
In time
Perfect
No less
The sun
Unknown
The way
Lord No
Begging
Someday
Silence
Visions
No laws
Finesse
No pain
Yeah...
Roar me
In song
He lied
Oh yeah
One day
No move
Hey man
Fuck it
Into it
Up here
Grew up
I do…
Just me
Go away
My view
Lose me
Really?
You say
The lie
Naughty
The fan
Move on
Be free
Tonight
Lost it
Believe
Goodbye
Rhyming
Me, too
In love
Awesome
Fly low
Poor me
Join me
A prize
I think
Her bag
A crowd
My sins
Of mine
Dogshit
You see
So soft
Science
A joke
Golden
Hiding
Rudely
Googly
Poetry
I knew
My sky
A club
Cryin'
Asleep
Always
Silver
My sun
A vase
Adrift
Gossip
Travel
Shader
Johnny
I died
Busted
Anyway
Hazing
Wonder
No man
Woolly
Lately
A sigh
Let go
A mask
A song
Me too
Change
Anyhow
Future
So sad
I walk

Nudity
Sold!
A lie
