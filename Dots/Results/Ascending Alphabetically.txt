A baby born all alone
A baby face
A bad kiss
A balance
A bank vault of all his friends
A beautiful night
A beautiful painting
A beautiful red earth
A beautiful view
A big china shelf
A big jam
A big old, hardhat river
A big smile
A bird of terror
A book of my soul
A bowl of flesh to eat
A brave, jealous, violent blind angel
A breeze now blows
A bride, a shining love
A brighter future
A brother room
A bunch of old songs
A busy time
A butterfly
A butterfly in your hand
A cage window
A chord that crosses a bridge
A city on the brink
A city town
A clattering dance
A cloud in the sky
A club
A clue
A collection of bad deeds
A colourless idol
A constant stream of lies
A corner of the room
A couple days ago
A crime against good law
A crowd
A crown
A dark heart
A demure and sweet feeling
A desperate dream
A difference between rose
A different ending
A divine personality
A doorbell rings
A dream of serenity
A drowsy little boy's job
A drug addict kid
A drug-crazed rage
A dying soul
A dying star
A feather in a jar
A feeling I can feel
A feeling that this was gonna last
A fight between opposites
A fine dress
A fine hill
A fine instrument
A fine trinity
A firework structure
A flaming shark
A fleeting scene
A fly in the night
A flying tram
A friend died
A friend of mine’s death
A funeral for him
A game changer
A game of mirrors
A garden cut leaves a dead star
A gentle wind
A ghost town
A gilded story
A girl I would never lose
A girl and a girl
A girl full of silver
A girl's voice
A glass of red
A glass of wine
A goal-maker
A good scene
A green beauty from cold
A gun for your phone
A habit to exist
A hallucinatory notion
A hatred so powerful
A haunting look
A heartbeat unravelling
A highway under one foot
A human hand
A human made of spirit
A hurricane's gonna catch up
A jet black stall
A joke
A key chord
A key in your game
A key to getting things done
A kid on my tomb
A kid walking around
A kindred spirit
A kiss in the desert
A kite’s wings
A knot in my throat
A lake of fire
A large ball of fire
A lawn is being cleaned
A lethal mist
A letter from you
A lie
A life free of suffering
A lifetime of loneliness
A light that is broken
A lighter no less
A line of flowers
A little bit of romance
A little blue hot
A little boy gets their nights
A little more earth is kept cold
A little under our wings
A lonely bag
A lonely way
A look back at my childhood
A loose stitch
A lost age
A lovable shit
A loveable blonde boy
A madman waiting for you
A man can dance
A man of principles
A man of steel
A man that can’t understand
A mask
A mellow voice
A mental question
A message that appears in the blue skies
A meteor ride
A midnight vision
A million miles away
A million people
A miracle
A month separates us
A motherfucking mess of me
A mountain of dead apples
A mysterious future
A nation of slaves
A new all-time high
A new kingdom
A new way to say yes
A new world
A newborn son
A nice flower
A nice job
A nine-year old living with demons
A pack in the air
A pain in the stomach
A pair of blonde ladies
A pair of sunglasses
A part of me
A part of you
A photo of little Lily
A photo on the wall
A pint of hard liquor
A place in hell
A place of amusement
A place to hide
A place to rest
A place where you love me
A place without anything but books
A planewalk
A policeman walkin' by at the tender age
A position held dear to her heart
A prince of sunshine
A princess shatters
A private place you see before
A prize
A promise
A promise of some value
A proud rhyme
A punch in the arm
A punchline
A rabbit?
A real bandit boy
A red flag you won't see
A rich, noble face
A rifle in your hand
A ring over your face
A riot with ghosts
A rock at the side of the road
A rock star now
A room full of people
A rose-tinted-glass
A sad time
A salute to the love-specialty
A scarlet kiss
A scarlet mess
A scene of fear
A screamer
A sea wave
A search for the spine
A sensitive song
A shadow of that youth
A shield
A shot through
A sickness of flesh
A sigh
A silver star
A simple human death
A single and innocent hero
A sister dreamed
A skull in your hand
A sleaze
A small rainbow
A smile on his face
A smile opens my eyes
A smiling baby
A snake of pride
A song
A song about greatness
A song the insects of war
A sorrowful world
A squirrel only grows up
A star of Babylon
A statue made of myself
A storm in the news
A storm of emotion
A sucker who knows nothing
A summerie doll
A sweet warm rainbow
A tear in his eye
A thief's play
A thousand nights in love
A thousand pages of a smooth head
A thousand strange images
A thousand ugly people
A thousand years of land
A tight green flag
A time for closing time
A time to cross the line
A timeless defeat
A torch is lit
A toy
A train of fire
A treasure that will come back
A tree I ride
A trip to the seas
A truer word
A twenty-five hour rampage
A universal claim
A vacant part
A vase
A vast tail of debt
A very minor obstacle
A very stupefying time
A view of disappointment
A vision
A voice inside my heart
A voice that will meet you
A warm dream
A warm wall
A warning tomorrow
A wave of love
A way of life
A weird crowd
A well-lit place
A while ago you used to see me
A white chicken
A wine vase
A witness to my misery
A wizard’s prison
A worthless rag
A young man just to give
A young, sharp-eyed boy
A-changin' like all these people
A-going-down
Aaaand all that wildness
Abandoned pet
Abandoned, shell-shocked, searching
Abandoning everything
About all your awful doings
About an hour ago
About equal time
About fourteen or eighteen feet away
About her
About lost years
About my music
About the law
About wanting to kiss something
Above a big cell
Above every monster
Above my crescendo
Above the stations
Above the times
Above your hour
Absolutely
Absolutely fucked off
Absolutely fucking killer
Absolutely true
Accept and abandon
Accept this door
Accept this favor
Accept your place
Accepting the things you're good at
Acorns for sung sirens
Acrobat made me awake
Across a barren beat
Across a river
Across the corner
Across the heavens
Across the ocean
Across the sea
Across the town
Across the water
Across this hill
Across your bony skull
Act at the same time
Act like the newborn
Act matter
Act of war
Add your clothes
Addicted to love
Addicted to pixie dust
Admired old swashbuckler
Admit it began with you
Adorably close to nothing
Adrift
Afraid I'm gonna cry
Afraid of light
Afraid to lose their love
Afraid you'll burn me
After all is said and done
After all she fought for
After all the rain
After looking for this
After your death
Afterward
Against all odds
Against the wall
Ah, and he’ll touch my heart
Ah, from Beneath the Wall
Ain't a city of pigs
Ain't all that matters
Ain't gonna be unkind to you
Ain't nobody doing it
Ain't there nothing wrong with me?
Ain’t like the world’s a city
Ain’t nobody’s role
Aired on a mist
Albeit it's kinda funny
Alive just in the grip of madness
Alive today
All God wants me to be
All I can do
All I can say
All I ever knew
All I know
All I need now
All I want is for you to die
All I want is you
All I want to do is pretend
All I want to say is new stars
All I've been was love
All aboard my ship
All along the lines of life
All around
All around me
All around the table
All around the world
All business
All day long
All day you go
All hell breaks loose
All her illusions
All in one neat lil' jet
All kinds of life trials
All life is alright
All love
All man-made crime
All men can do
All men seem to love
All men will be sailors
All my hearts are in your pocket
All my tears
All new toys
All night and day
All of my free time
All of my friends are singing
All of them crying
All of them outside
All of this is for me
All of us getting fired
All of you
All of you falling apart
All our feelings
All over
All over the city
All over the street
All over the whole city
All over your body
All power to the devil
All right
All right now
All right with you
All signs are for a bad change
All talk of flying
All that stuff
All the better for it
All the buildings fall down
All the children's songs
All the dead wings belong to her
All the evils
All the girllike gems
All the great things
All the houses in town
All the laws
All the little angels in yellow
All the losers
All the memories
All the new language
All the people’s dishes
All the pictures
All the praise
All the rest are dead
All the speed making this show reel
All the stones follow you
All the things I used to do
All the waves I drag
All the way through
All these lights parted
All these minutes of your time
All these nightpaths
All these warnings
All they say
All things you’ve seen
All this time
All through eternity
All through the night
All through town
All times long
All too strong
All we made was for you
All we've got to do
All will be fine
All you can do
All you got to say
All you people you knew
All your dreams do
All your scars
All your suits
All you’ll ever see
Allow me to keep you waiting
Aloha
Alone
Alone in a corner
Alone in a room
Alone in awe
Alone on our honeymoon
Alright first time's the charm
Always
Always been that way
Always changing
Always gonna be like you
Always keep my little princess smiling
Always satisfied
Always sigh
Always-living everybody
Am I supposed to sound like a nightmare
America is a shark
Among the stars
Among your shattered teeth
Amongst the dead in solitude
Amusing the imagination
An Indian sorcerer
An amazing smile
An angel of God
An anger-filled cave
An art in the kitchen
An ending
An endless stream of love
An enemy
An entirely different animal
An eternally cool morning
An eternity
An exact duplicate
An honest revelation
An hourglass I’m seen in the airport
An ideal place to show the world
An immortal flame
An incongruous destiny
An old friend
An order to you
An unspoken legacy
An untold story
And I
And I didn't know what I saw
And I didn’t know
And I died this year
And I don't know what
And I feel nothing
And I fell for you
And I find myself waiting
And I know it’s coming
And I know that
And I know this because I’ve got to it
And I know what they do
And I made a mistake
And I see it clearly
And I see you
And I shall win again
And I slept it up
And I think you’ve done
And I wanted to tease you
And I wasn't there at the wedding
And I will die tomorrow
And I wonder how
And I ’ve got no shame
And I've got it in me
And I’ll be fine
And I’ll have you know
And I’ll never stop
And I’m in love
And I’m sorry it felt so good
And I’m up
And I’ve no idea
And again
And all three of you die
And as the sun shines
And ask me that
And at what price
And because of the way you look?
And bring about violence
And cold blood leads to poverty
And come back the other way
And cuddle a deer
And didn't say I was sorry
And don’t give up
And every sound you made
And for you
And forget about me
And get inside your body
And half the door
And he makes mistakes
And here it is
And here we come this morning
And he’ll be waiting
And he’ll try to dance
And he’s bearing the bullshit
And he’s the king
And how cool it is
And if it all ends on the same day
And if you were
And in my memory
And in the morning
And in the next revolution
And in this dream
And is it guilt you need?
And it got darker
And it went way too slow
And it’s doing fine
And it’s no wonder
And it’s wrong
And kiss and weave
And let me know
And listen
And my body is sinking
And my wicked tongue can sing
And no more lies
And now I feel something good
And now I see
And now come and go
And now it’s over
And now it’s time to say goodbye
And now that she thinks I can see
And now the blood boiling
And now they broke away
And now you are
And one of my violent rules
And one of the seed holes
And please mind your touch
And rids the world of evil
And said, it wouldn't hurt to be free
And say how men are nice
And see the great light
And set to dance
And she came and danced
And she had to change places
And she saw the master once again
And she wants to be there
And sit without love
And smile again
And smile like a girl
And smoke stains your eyes
And so I’ve got this squinted eye
And so she let him down
And some more than others
And someday you will
And soothes my heart
And stay away
And still I’m human
And teach your children love
And that I feel I am getting
And that darkness
And that we all belong
And the airlocks in the saddle
And the darkness and winter
And the double life’s in conflict
And the fear?
And the fear’s gone
And the future of my existence
And the room
And the shells of times gone
And the soundtrack to gangsta rap
And the whole sky
And then I died
And then I was like, What are you doing?
And then he attacked
And then it hurts
And then it is gone
And then it’s all over
And then it’s back
And then the silhouette
And there is truth in my heart
And there's nothing you can do
And they believe
And they broke it down
And they go by
And they tell me
And this time you are
And thought he would keep a secret
And to be so naive
And to live forever
And to no one in particular
And today
And two laws
And we got to start laughing
And we knew
And we're going home
And we’ll go as far as we can
And what can I do?
And what is darkness until the last scene
And when we reach for her
And who knew?
And with no holy flag
And yes, I know
And yet I know
And yet I’m growing tired
And yet you’re smiling
And you are satisfied
And you can hear it now
And you can’t win
And you don’t take my word for it
And you just want to wake
And you know
And you know it?
And you laugh
And you left
And you see a man
And you want to kiss me
And you're taking care of you?
And you're watching
And you've never seen his worst?
And you’re alone
And you’re keeping me high
And you’re ours
And you’re so uptight
And you’re the boss
And you’re tired of it
And you’re watching
And you’ve got a question mark
And you’ve never found the security
Angel as glow in the moon
Anger flows down my spine
Another I’ll come home
Another battle
Another chain of censorship
Another city to call
Another day with the crime
Another down year
Another fan
Another journey through the night
Another man on the bench
Another story
Another time
Another time, another time
Another trick
Another way to end things
Another year or two
Another years from now
Any chance I can get
Any chance you can get
Any clues you've found
Any damn time will tell me so
Any life is a story
Any, do you mean, anything?
Anybody else?
Anybody follow me?
Anybody knows
Anyhow
Anyone knows me
Anything but trash
Anything for sale
Anything goes
Anything that makes you want to scream
Anything to help me get there
Anything you could say
Anything you might say
Anything you need to do
Anytime you put your hat on
Anyway
Anyway to keep things a secret
Anyway you brought me here
Anywhere you could go
Anywho’s mind is mine
Arbours come all the way around
Are the pills faster than our eyes?
Are the years of pursuit around you?
Are we comfortable here?
Are you afraid?
Are you awake today?
Are you crazy?
Are you going to be ok?
Are you going to fail me now?
Are you here?
Are you hurting me?
Are you so cold?
Are you with me?
Around the clock
Around the town
As I can only watch
As I fell asleep
As I walk the highway
As I was thinking
As a reflection
As beautiful as your promises
As cool as he was
As for a voice that could rap
As good as these tits of yours
As he closes his mouth
As if they saw
As it rains
As it stands now
As long as I stay
As long as I watch the country fall
As long as I’ve been asleep
As much pleasure as I can get
As near as you can get
As new as she appears
As soft as they can sing
As soon as I can feel her today
As soon as I hear you
As soon as my darling dream comes true
As the devil
As they say, the shortening of memory
As warm as you can touch
As we have died
As we were killing time
As you sleep
As you wake
Asap is a blessing
Ashes my soul
Ask a piece of your mind
Ask anybody
Ask her, when?
Ask me one question
Ask me, why I don’t go?
Ask that boy why
Ask the others
Asking him to get home
Asleep
Asleep in a chair
Asleep’s ready to be asleep
Asphyxiating my dreams
Assemble the spark of a hurricane
At a mealtime
At all times
At first
At first, we need each other
At home
At last I got my chance
At least now they do laugh
At once confused and confused
At peace
At that time
At the best job
At the bottom of a noose
At the start
At this time I'll be alone
Attacking yourself
Attracted to you by the noise
Attracts your attention
Awesome
Awesome height and style
Aye to hell
Baby
Baby wants to move out of me
Baby your little tail
Baby you’re at least kidding?
Baby, it won't come again
Baby, slow the blood fly
Baby’s eyes are watering
Back again
Back for the night
Back home, there
Back in the day
Back in the game
Back in the shadows
Back in the ways
Back my dreams
Back of the tongue
Back on the run
Back to making the place my dream
Back to sleep
Back to some strange place
Back to square one
Back to the old ways
Back to what I thought it meant
Back up to hide
Back when I was young
Bad as they were
Bad ass over again
Bad brother
Bad falls in love
Bad luck
Bad to the soul
Bam it sounds like a stretch
Barely fitting my soul
Bastard at all
Battering glass
Battle on my mind
Battle ready for the outside world
Be away from it all
Be careful for the kings of emptiness
Be free
Be free to ride
Be gentle
Be here in the house
Be in love
Be like Mom on fire
Be prepared for the attack
Be quiet and dream
Be sure you’ve seen me
Be too young
Beat a big time
Beat their minds from the inside
Beat you up like a beast
Beat your wheel
Beautiful and moving
Beautiful to see
Beautiful to watch
Because I will be fine
Because I'm awake
Because I’m such a shame
Because of you
Because of your glory
Because you’re my lover
Because you’re sold
Becomes a part of you
Becomes all gone
Becomes hot
Becoming a man
Becoming your own brother
Been a long time ago
Been away for days
Been awhile since you started
Been crying and laughing in your head
Been looking for the time machine
Been quiet since we met
Been sick and tired of telling you
Been taken by a spell
Been through their yarmulkes
Been up all night
Been waiting for you I’m not satisfied
Before he died
Before he’s gone
Before that floor
Before the wheels come off
Before we started
Before you know it
Before you were alive
Before your hands glide
Before your statue
Begging
Begging for blood
Begging for gold
Begging for him
Begin to sleep
Behind a black curtain
Behind all the stars
Behind him
Behind the camera
Behind the curtain
Behind the iron bars
Behind the lights of your dreams
Behind the long and soft glow
Behind the pipe
Behind the waves
Behind them
Behind those asleep
Behind you
Being a commodity
Believe
Believe in one belief
Believe you once and for all
Bending the world
Beneath everything
Beneath the branches
Beneath the crack of wind
Best of all worlds
Betrayal
Betrayal a bad son
Better hear me now
Better hold your nose
Better off playing our game
Better play dead
Better terrify the breeze
Better than kings
Better that you’re satisfied
Between my eyes
Between running and sleep
Between the rock-solid blocks
Between the streets
Between us
Bewildered
Beyond a shadow
Beyond a thousand jagged walls
Beyond on the daily stream
Beyond the exile
Beyond the street
Beyond this poem
Big and powerful
Big bitch
Big lovable face
Big mistake
Big picture
Big secret
Bikes running on the ground
Bite the heartstrings
Bitter as ice
Black Dahlia
Black hoodie
Black or white
Black porcelain and plumage
Black slips and silver wires
Black strap
Black virgin, naked star
Blackbird blue
Blame you
Blaming your boss
Bless the morning
Bling my eyes
Block
Blocked their throats
Blood
Blood and lava
Blood being poured down the streets
Blood comes down in veins
Blood drips down the street
Blood for me
Blood in veins
Blood is the light
Blood moon
Blood on the chalkboard
Blood row
Blood star
Blood still breathing
Blood written like wax
Blood-drenched things
Bloodletting
Bloodline is broken
Bloodlines
Bloodlines in my veins
Bloodstained angel hair
Bloodstains to our memory
Blow around for fun
Blow by the sea
Blow for the grave
Blow his head off
Blow my nose
Blow our minds
Blow the whistle
Blow your dreams
Blowing in my mouth
Blowing out my heart
Blowing red to everyone
Blowing us out
Blown away
Blows out
Blows your drink
Blue and white
Blue dresses
Blue earth
Blue gills
Blue mist
Blue mountain way
Blue sky
Blushing
Bodies of love
Bodies run high
Bones sway
Boogie man, what a mess
Boring and endless
Born again
Born from the prison we broke
Born in dreams
Born of a thousand bombs
Born on their nights
Born on this paper
Born strong
Born to be treated
Born to do it
Born to find
Born to kill
Born to wander
Born without a word
Born you’re lonely
Borrows the lyrical rhythms
Both of you
Both on my high horse
Both sides come together
Bottle of soul
Bought me a lifetime
Bought there in the deep blue
Bounced in pain
Bouncing kite
Bound apart
Bound down and dead
Bound to decay
Bound to nowhere
Bragging
Brain me hard
Brand new blood
Brand new carpet
Brand new singing
Brash and insecure
Break the rest of the world
Breaking in from nowhere
Breaking your pride
Breaking your strength
Breathe it out
Breathe quick
Bright fingers
Bring back watermelon
Bring her down
Bring home the star
Bring it down
Bring it for me
Bring me down
Bring me freedom
Bring me not so easily
Bring me notes
Bring me out with you
Bring me through
Bring my duties to you
Bring out the dustweavers
Bring them my love
Bring you your spirit
Bring your eyes close
Bring your future before me
Bringing the rain down
Brings shame
Brings tear apart my existence
Broke all my dream
Broke glass in a jar
Broke in your jail
Broke my heart
Broke past you
Broke the bridge
Broke the door
Broke the lock
Broken Heart
Broken all the walls
Broken chords
Broken from orbit
Broken relationship
Broken souls
Broken stetship
Broom together
Brother
Brought chaos
Brought in from the dead
Brought me all the stress
Brought you on
Brushing his teeth
Buck, beat your teeth
Buckets full of wealth
Build a new life
Build me a bridge
Bullshit is just a weapon
Bully of civil liberty
Bullying
Bump my baby mouth
Buried by a falling star
Buried in the trees
Buried inside hell
Buried somewhere else
Buried treasure
Burn again
Burn down doors
Burn her fire
Burn like a fluke
Burn my memory
Burn my mind
Burn the hole
Burn the papers
Burn to ashes
Burned from the crown
Burned in the ashes
Burned rainbows
Burner's ain't men
Burning down the middle ground
Burning flames in the sky
Burning flesh from the saddle
Burning in the night
Burning inside
Burning it all down
Burning midnight
Burning something cool
Burning sun
Burning the house
Buses in the sky
Busted
Busted from all my dreams
But I always loved you
But I don’t care
But I gotta have you
But I have no one around
But I won't see you again
But I'm not getting along
But I’m going to fly
But I’ve got the red pill
But about tomorrow
But all I see is yellow
But all it took was a little fella singing
But before this fading sunlight
But beware all the evils
But don’t let you at all
But for a change
But here I am
But how you got there
But if you’re right
But instead we all look down on you
But it was the first time we all talked
But it’s dying
But it’s so damn hard
But just within the next two minutes
But life's a trap
But look at you
But on the other hand
But some won’t pay
But the darkness’s a blot
But the hand is weeping
But the nails that hang on my own knees
But the sky
But then again
But then it hit me
But then she passed out
But there ain't room to move
But there was hope
But there's no such thing
But there’s nothing you can do
But they don’t want to know
But they’re all safely parted
But this is its own story
But we still have a little to do
But what does the world look like?
But what if your body was naked?
But when it rains
But where do I go?
But where do you get the government money?
But why not
But you can fly by your side
But you don’t go out here
But you have nothing
But you know it doesn't matter
But you should stop kissing me
But you still took it from me
But your suit is leather
But you’ll find me in the world
But you’ll go
But you’ll show
But you’re just there to be
But you’re mine
But you’re my girl
But, won't you know that I gave you this?
Butts and paninis
By killing you
By the age of forty-five
By the hand
By the star towers
By the waves
Call me cool
Call me home
Call me new
Call me the madman
Call me weak
Call to arms
Called all your fairy tales
Called for help
Called her name
Called your child
Calling for it
Calling for peace
Calling him a monster
Calling myself the brokenhearted
Calling the age out
Calling to his face
Calm down
Calm down now
Calm the sky
Came as a merry man
Came into my body
Came on, come on
Came straight down
Can I feel it now?
Can I feel your heart beating
Can I have a friend?
Can I help you?
Can I reach you inside?
Can I see?
Can I stay home?
Can anyone relate
Can be the sweet side
Can come next time
Can go to heaven
Can hear my silhouette
Can no one stop me?
Can only be sold by famous people
Can see my reflection
Can see right through it
Can we come together?
Can you even put on that monologue
Can you find an ad?
Can you find me?
Can you reach the gate?
Can you see it through
Can you see it?
Can you see?
Can you tie me to a chair
Can't be bothered with that
Can't cry
Can't face you
Can't fight truth
Can't find our nose
Can't get enough
Can't get upset
Can't hear me do it
Can't help but cry
Can't hide
Can't see you again
Can't seem to get over
Can't stay in our place
Can't you just be as sweet as she says
Candy
Candyman’s face
Can’t do it anymore
Can’t do it tonight
Can’t have you know
Can’t leave your own stalker
Can’t pay attention
Can’t seem to change
Can’t stay neutral
Can’t you feel the pressure
Care for your money
Care to feel your own?
Care to play this song
Carefully and gently
Carefully thinking about tomorrow
Carefully to see the truth
Careless heh
Carrying the enemy out
Carrying the king
Cast a shadow
Cast her memories in your heart
Cast me as your foreign enemy
Cast out the darkness
Cast the same pattern as we did
Cast your biggest test
Catch the street’s lights
Catch up
Catch your face
Catch your hand
Catch yourself in your mind
Caught as a shadow
Caught in a trap
Caught in this time
Caught keeping your heart cracked
Caught on video
Caught our money
Caught staring at me
Caught the fire
Caught up in a misunderstanding
Caught up in a spinning haze
Caught up in the crowd
Cause I know your words
Cause it’s okay
Cause nothing can be done
Cause this alone
Celebrate our King
Celebrate the hopelessness
Change
Change an attitude
Change me
Change the brightness
Change the eyes
Change the past
Change your method
Changes matter less
Changes to your voice
Changes what we know
Changing colours
Changing my mind
Changing the wash
Changing your mind
Chasing an ever-increasing appeal
Chasing and beating
Chasing interest
Chasing into fire
Chasing me
Chasing the brightness
Chasing the moon
Chasing this high name
Chasing you
Chasing you down
Check it out
Check out the snow
Check the roll of your eyes
Check the rules
Check to see who can show up
Check your cupboard
Checking down
Checking your goddamn day
Checkmate with you
Chump me
City control
Cleaned up shit
Clear
Clear hair
Clear line up
Clear love for ourselves
Clear my mind
Clear the sky
Click on a wall
Climb a wall
Climb on top of my head
Climb the ladder
Climb up
Climbing in heaven
Climbing into the sky
Climbing the tree
Clones out his wings
Close my eyes
Close the book
Close-up art
Closest place to a burning bush
Cold blooded secrets
Cold hearted heart
Cold steel
Cold take the water
Coldness taunts them
Coloring there
Colors changing
Colors fade
Colours change direction
Come aboard our dead planes
Come and go
Come and show
Come at me
Come down all alone
Come down to the fiery sea
Come for me
Come here, knock on my door
Come in and I will sleep
Come in the wind
Come in there to dance
Come inside me
Come late
Come on behind me
Come on down
Come on down in a door
Come on down the road
Come on honey
Come on in
Come on in the darkness
Come on ladies
Come on now, that leaves the room
Come on over
Come on pupils
Come on sweetie
Come on you
Come on!
Come on, boy
Come on, come on
Come out and just lay there
Come to a crossroads
Come to finish this sorrow
Come to ruin
Come to this place
Come together
Come, come, come, come into that rush?
Comfortable in the mouth
Comin' together
Coming from heaven
Coming from within
Coming here now
Coming here’s nothing but pride
Cominning-glass
Committed suicide
Common cause
Common enemy
Complete
Completely in pain
Comrade sheriff
Concoct one thing and pass it off as art
Confessions
Confrontation
Confused
Confused, desperate
Confusing your fantasy
Confusion
Connecting in my mind
Convinced I couldn’t look on
Convinced that I'd follow them
Convinced we're done
Cool
Cool fellas with names
Cool out and remind us
Cool sailing
Cool that mind control train
Cool; you’re trying your best together
Could be you’re madder than hate
Could not find the time to go to work
Couldn't ever lay it down
Couldn't have done this
Couldn't survive the warning
Couldn’t beat this song
Cover
Cover me
Cover me with tape
Cover the frame
Cover the storm
Cover up the roads
Cover with a wet velvet rope
Cover your ears
Cover your eyes
Covered in mud
Cracking out the first wave
Crap that clings
Crashes his face
Crashing apart in my body
Crashing at night
Crashing through the night
Crashing through your mind
Cried before
Crooked tramp
Crossing a line
Crossing the country
Crossing the waters
Crucify it
Crude and caustic
Crude free unmade
Crude inside
Crude price
Cruel red country
Crumbling down
Crushing his throne
Cry Caroline
Cry all right
Cry as I dance
Cry before the gods
Cry in the shade
Cry to the cop
Cryin'
Crying against time
Crying all night
Crying all the time
Crying and weeping for the cross
Crying in fear
Crying my name
Crying now
Crying pills
Crying too loud
Cupid's thousand doos
Curse, bury, come down on stage
Curtain shrieking mirror
Curtain spouts
Cut down the trees
Cut it out of the sunshine
Cut me a train
Cut through all the dryers
Cut up in your hands
Cut you off and drag your arms around
Cut-off end
Cute dust
Cutting and going through with it
Cutting into the heart
Cutting through haze
Cutting through the lines
Dainty game
Damage that fades and more
Damaged friends
Damaged memories
Damages of record
Damn, this is how you paint a story
Dance
Dance and dance
Dance of horns
Dance out your exclamation
Dance to the tune of your heart
Dance with angels
Dancing a fine tune
Dancing alive
Dancing around like it’s forever
Dancing below
Dancing from the roof
Dancing like music
Dancing stock footage
Dancing through the gloom
Dancing to the beat of your own drum
Dancing together
Dancing with music
Dancing with the devil
Dark clouds parted
Dark clouds seem insomniac
Dark rain
Dark smoke
Dark streets you dragged through
Dark themes
Darkest journey
Darkness in the night
Darkness inside
Dawning news
Day after day
Day passes
Dead after all
Dead bird
Dead giveth someone a reason
Dead in the streets
Dead men and sea children
Dead men breathe
Dead on end
Dead or alive
Dead paper tiger
Deadbeat into a frenzy
Deaf heartsets
Dealt your heart
Death by chance
Death does fear you
Death in his form
Death of a gentleman
Death of the unborn
Deceive you
Decent way to go
Deemed the love of my life
Deep dreams are held
Deep inside
Deep inside my heart
Deep inside tonight
Deep sleep
Deep white sea
Deep within my soul
Deep within you
Degenerative wealth
Depends on how you feel
Depends on your timing
Desire to get laid
Desperate times
Destroy my soul
Destroy your enemy
Destroying a tune
Destroying the truth
Determination is my strength
Devil for your money
Dibbing my heart
Did I hurt you?
Did you know?
Did you watch pornstars when you were young?
Didn't change
Didn't feel so bad about it
Didn't move your game
Didn't want to make your heart throw
Didn't you know that?
Didn't you know you were coming all the way?
Didn't you notice me?
Didn’t know
Didn’t mean it
Didn’t move my hair
Didn’t touch you
Die
Die before me
Die more slowly
Died for the time
Died in a pit of infamy
Died of a wound
Different colour palette
Different love
Different numbers
Different son of a bitch
Different sorts of dreams
Different strands of meat
Dig another hole
Dig more into my womb
Dig them back up
Digital footprints
Dilemma here
Diner at the devil's table
Directs myself from behind
Dirt from home
Dirt got cleaned
Dirt on the ground
Dirt tracks
Dirty dishes
Dirty dreams are turned upside down
Dirty guest
Dirty the powder
Dirty trick king
Dirty until I clear my secret
Disagree with my opinions
Disappeared
Disappoint me
Disapprove me
Disciples of the fiery skies
Disconnect them all
Discovered your baby
Disguised him
Disillusionment
Dismantling the weeds
Dismembering me
Dismissed man’s beliefs
Displays the veil
Distant I guess
Distant thought
Distilled down her heart
Distortion
Distractions
Disturbing our shyness
Diving in title: While I grow older
Do it together
Do not be insincere
Do something
Do something like that
Do something you didn't mean to do
Do the dishes
Do the right thing
Do what you can
Do what you must
Do you care?
Do you know how to take it from me
Do you know me?
Do you know where I am?
Do you know where we’ll be tomorrow?
Do you like to play?
Do you need it?
Do you need me now?
Do you see me?
Do you think I am wrong
Do you think you will ever come?
Does it look weird?
Does not sound right to you
Does this look like me?
Doesn't get much worse
Doesn't look like my heart
Doesn't matter what you say
Doesn't matter who wins
Doesn't really work yet
Dogeared on the shore
Dogma
Dogshit
Doing so is all over
Doing your best to please
Doing your own thing
Don't be so impatient
Don't bring us down
Don't call me jealous
Don't cast it off in me
Don't catch me like I'm not here
Don't change a thing
Don't feel bad about it
Don't force you
Don't get me wrong
Don't give me the bed
Don't hurt him too much
Don't laugh at me
Don't let the space kiddos win
Don't lose me
Don't make me cry
Don't piss me off
Don't touch it
Don't turn me down
Don't you want to be here?
Don’t ask for anything
Don’t attack me
Don’t be afraid
Don’t be afraid to call me
Don’t be king
Don’t believe in me
Don’t bother until the present day
Don’t call me old-fashioned
Don’t care
Don’t come back here
Don’t cry
Don’t cry for a minute
Don’t die
Don’t dream of this
Don’t expect to move so easily
Don’t feel like dying
Don’t forget
Don’t forget it
Don’t forget me
Don’t forget your cardigan
Don’t grow up
Don’t have faith
Don’t have it hard
Don’t have to feel bad about it
Don’t hold your breath
Don’t hurt me
Don’t know when
Don’t laugh
Don’t leave me alone
Don’t let him see
Don’t let up
Don’t like crying
Don’t look at me like that
Don’t look down
Don’t lose sight of what we all stand on
Don’t make any mistakes
Don’t make me look
Don’t mind if I remain
Don’t mind me
Don’t mind me, come on
Don’t need my help
Don’t rush me around
Don’t sleep
Don’t spare her memories
Don’t stare at you
Don’t stay
Don’t take up your morning
Don’t treat me like something else
Don’t trust me
Don’t try to get away
Don’t walk in the same room
Don’t walk like that
Don’t waltz out
Don’t wanna try
Don’t waste your time
Don’t wear your skirt
Don’t you agree?
Don’t you care?
Don’t you feel the force of tomorrow
Don’t you want me?
Doppelganger
Down a path
Down as an addict
Down at the beach
Down at the truth
Down by law
Down down your arm
Down here
Down in Washington
Down in darkness
Down in the basement
Down in the frozen cemetery
Down in the pool
Down in the room
Down in this park
Down in winter
Down in your own world
Down out on the warm streets
Down that dance floor
Down the ages
Down the road
Down through the eyes of a dying fool
Down to earth images
Down to our feet
Down to the rest
Down under the land of hollies
Down with a revolution
Down with abuse
Down with all my passions
Down with all the noise
Down with sadness
Down with sun
Down with the outside world
Down with the split china
Down with your butter-swinging leads
Down with your filth
Downed the river
Downing the ceiling
Downright fun
Downstairs watching you face the world
Downstairs, upstairs
Drawing electric
Drawn a picture
Drawn my senses
Dream about going down
Dream about the shore
Dream is over
Dream it out
Dream of me
Dream our big name
Dream through the day
Dream together
Dreamers of tomorrow
Dreaming
Dreaming of changing my words
Dreaming of disaster
Dreaming of savagery
Dreaming of someday
Dreams and dream visions
Dreams are broken
Dreams are worth living
Dreams became permanent
Dreams too extreme
Dressed up for the night
Dressing, or in a wheelchair?
Drifting mind
Drink all you want
Drink nothing but bleach
Drink the ashes and pour the dew
Drink the good news
Drink the water
Drink their vodka
Drink what you can
Drink's on my mind
Drinking here
Drinking in this world
Drinking rainbows
Drive me back
Driven into a rage
Drive’s filled
Driving in the cold
Driving on the earth
Drop all your crap
Drop dead slow
Drop down
Drop it and pass it
Drop off
Drop our love
Drop the Candy
Drop the worst of your silly ways
Droping bells
Dropping
Drown the palette
Drowned in cold water
Drowning all your dreams
Dry spell
Dumb music
Dump me’s head
During the last dance
During the month before Christmas
During the offseason
Dust the earth
Dust the lighter I wish
Dust your shit down
Dust-filled town
Dying alone
Dying now
Dying only to go
Each building comes full steam ahead
Each of us is a part of our story
Each song
Eager to catch someone else
Eager to meet the cat
Easy
Easy to reach
Eat me alive
Eat the tears I'm taking
Either another mile walk
Either move or die
Either we sing or die
Elevate a stage
Embrace kindness
Emotionally great
Emotions are moving so fast
Emotions can't wash
Emptiness
Empty evil
Empty in your hand
Enablers
Enclosing doors
End my life
End of process
End the mission
Enduring every terror
Enough for them to hate
Enough is enough
Enough of fame
Enough pain in your bones
Enough the golden harp
Entangled in an endless chain
Entangling himself
Entangling me in the sand
Enter
Entire nation is already dead
Entitled
Envision a beautiful world
Erased the title
Erasing bloodlines
Erecting a pitiful creation
Escape the world
Escape-scene
Eternal sunset
Even as I'm dying
Even dance backwards
Even deep in the tunnels
Even if the gave
Even pendant and dog
Even the fan has a mouth
Ever forget your names
Ever got lost
Ever keep on keeping up
Ever looking for your way
Ever since she came to you
Ever sorry
Every bit of it
Every country in heaven
Every day
Every day I am awake
Every day I hide
Every day my soul is weeping
Every dream comes true
Every dream is a nightmare
Every fallen branch
Every final shot
Every friend of mine
Every gun
Every indecision comes nearer
Every little thing
Every memory gets improved
Every minute
Every moment made me believe
Every penny
Every place I’m gone
Every thing
Every thing I did
Every time
Every time I do
Every time I read
Every wave of the sun
Every wound dies
Everybody I know’s watching
Everybody and his fucking brother
Everybody around me
Everybody else on the moon
Everybody else will want to catch up
Everybody else’s home
Everybody feels down
Everybody finds their feet
Everybody from inside
Everybody gets their own way
Everybody in the town
Everybody knows it’s the same
Everybody knows, dance to a tune
Everybody must love
Everybody said we did it wrong
Everybody says
Everybody wants to ride
Everybody's missing your face
Everybody’s alive
Everybody’s doing alright
Everybody’s laughing
Everybody’s so perfect
Everybody’s wondering?
Everyday I’m a lonely one
Everyday life is empty
Everyone I know
Everyone else inside
Everyone else's ring
Everyone knows
Everyone listens
Everyone said you were
Everyone's dying
Everything I got
Everything I've been through
Everything breaks
Everything good you are right now
Everything in your hands
Everything is in place
Everything is yours
Everything looks awful
Everything of good and evil
Everything seems fine
Everything she had before
Everything up my sleeve
Everything you have known
Everything you need to know
Everything you've been told
Everytime
Evil Angel
Evil control freak
Evil feeling
Evil in your eyes
Evil that keeps the city still
Examine you
Excerpted from one star in the sky
Excessive drinking
Excessive force
Exclaim the sky
Exclaiming ourselves
Excuse me but I’m doing it wrong
Excuse me?
Exhaling for the flesh
Exorcise death
Exorcism
Explain everything
Explain it to me
Explain that you are everywhere
Explain to us
Explain why you are a bad dancer
Expose each other
Extremely satisfied
Eyes belong to me
Eyes in the hills
Eyes of ravens
Eyes on her lips
Eyes on the floor
Eyes open and pure and what is there of me
Eyes that are kinder than snow
Eyes wide and tired
Eyes wide open
Face in a bottle
Fades out
Fading through dreams
Fake stories
Fake things
Fall down
Fall in love
Fall off the planet
Fallen angels
Fallen in love
Falling apart
Falling asleep in your arms
Falling asleep is hard
Falling down
Falling for you
Falling in love
Falling into darkness
Falling over
Falling rain
Fantastic world
Far apart
Far away and better than you know
Far away is the wall
Far enough now
Far from adrift
Far from free
Far from it
Far in the future
Far to go dead
Farewell to redefined cold depths
Fear me when I grow old
Fearsome little girl
Feed the king
Feel at home
Feel bad for her
Feel for something
Feel free
Feel free to cuss
Feel free to eat
Feel free to go
Feel free to grow from me
Feel good for a moment
Feel it grow empty
Feel it in my eyes
Feel like the ant, someone said
Feel myself afraid
Feel so different
Feel the fire and weep
Feel the lightpour
Feel the line
Feel the things within
Feel the thrill of freedom
Feel yourself in the future
Feeling abandoned
Feeling an affair with Jesus
Feeling away
Feeling chills
Feeling like a moth
Feeling like you only know
Feeling powerful
Feeling pretty
Feeling sad
Feeling sick
Feeling so tired
Feeling the sun ruin
Feeling the thunder in the sky
Feeling too quiet
Feeling your feet running
Felt ready
Felt wrong
Fierce from the mouth
Fighting to get through
Fill him with cold tears
Fill up and rattle
Filled with Curses
Filled with bitterness
Filled with milk
Finally got a head start
Finally here I come
Finally liberty if you get back on stage
Finally, you look here
Find a prince
Find a reason to fight
Find another reason
Find another way to die
Find him pretty
Find it just the right way
Find out how to stop it
Find some understanding
Find something of value
Find the children
Find the truth
Find time
Find your things
Finders only deep inside yourself
Finding my own destiny
Finding your own salvation
Finds my friends
Finds room for her evil laughter
Finesse
Fire
Fire and anger
Fire and fury
Fire up your mind
Fire within the span of time
Fireball
Fireflies fly
First I spent my life pursuing a mystery
First and only chance
First and only dreams
First come, first served
First he saw me
First man in the world
First name from the tomb
First of all
First of all, let me show you the doors
First put on a wrong
First things first
First time
First time of summer
First time over long ago
First time unheard of
First time unpack
First to take control
Fists of hay
Fitted to live here
Five to one
Fix it up
Fix the darkness
Flailing
Flash light
Flashing out the doors
Flashing through a distorted mind
Flashing through the streets
Flashs of hell
Floating before the sun
Floating in the air
Floating in the sea
Floating island
Flowing water in your hand
Flown away by one sick old cannibal
Flows from your head
Fly a thousand miles
Fly again
Fly all over the city
Fly all over the sky
Fly away
Fly away and soar
Fly blind
Fly by force
Fly down the street
Fly from one crisis to the next
Fly him along
Fly in one band
Fly in this green cloud
Fly low
Fly on the sky
Fly there's no hell
Fly through the sky
Fly to stars
Fly to your own memory
Fly with red coat
Flying a balloon
Flying a light sigh
Flying bridge
Flying by a thousand sticks
Flying dreams
Flying low
Flying on the horizon
Flying over the air
Flying past home
Flying the rainbow
Flying through the sky
Flying to America
Flying to the countryside
Flying vinyl
Followed by the others
Fooled or pleased
Foolishness—what to me
Fools dream of success
Fools say you’re friends
Fools you
Fools, idiots and bunnies
For a day
For a month there is weeping
For a present
For a reason in your mind
For a stroke of luck
For ages
For all eternity
For all our deep grief
For all this time
For every bar you dance
For his sins
For just a moment
For live silver
For making our call
For miles along the highway
For my part
For my warm call
For nothing
For once
For some I could hold
For some reason
For ten thousand years
For the Italian goldfish
For the better too
For the dead wailing
For the infamy
For the man
For the tips
For the world
For this is your home
For three days
For three days old
For what’s good
For with love
Foreskin simpletons
Forever running
Forever speechless
Forever will be
Forever’s mine
Forget about a dream
Forget all the shades
Forget any pleasure
Forget everything
Forget that week
Forget your devotion
Forget your wands
Forgetting for a moment
Fortunate to have won
Found a roof
Found fire from my fire
Found paradise
Found something that interests me
Found these bags
Found you
Foundered
Foundling
Four empty blue pills
Four planes
Four winds, seven sides
Freakin' everybody he meets
Freaking
Freaking the wind
Freaks don't understand
Freaks from outer space
Free and free
Free me from my disappointments
Free your soul
Freedom feels so beautiful
Freedom from fear
Freedom just won't let me die
Freedom no matter what we do
Freedom of speech
Freedom of the will
Freedom room
Freedom to act like I'm in a mine
Freedom’s only opportunity
Freeing me and killing me
Fresh from the grave
Fresh juice
Friends I held
Friends and family
Friends on the flowers
Friends with a free mind
Friendship will fail
From corruption and red flags
From death and mourning
From hell
From here to nowhere
From inside out
From just another substitute
From knowing the ancient fate
From my heart
From now on
From our balconies
From street to gate
From the depths
From the empty little floor
From the garb of the night
From the mouth of a pig
From the mouth to the lips
From the ocean floor
From the pages of the old songs
From the piece of me
From the spinners
From this knife to your feet
From this place
From thorns to watery eyes
From time to time
From your mouth
From: Young Voices
Frosty black machine
Fuck it
Fuck that statue
Fuckin down that road
Fucking hangover
Fucking rock of the night
Fucking rotten water
Fucking say what?
Fucking send me home
Fucking stare at me
Fucking stumbled across a lie
Full of gutter glue
Full of life
Full of nonsense
Full of passion
Full of shit
Full of sorrow
Full of waste
Fully blurred vision
Fumbling through sentences
Future
Future cargoes
Future's key to victory
Gangway out of control
Gather the truth
Gave every move
Gave it my all
Gave me grief
Gave me my arm
Gave up already
Gave you all my success
Gazing down as I go
Gentlemen for a man
Gentlemens
Get a tan
Get angry
Get at the inside
Get down on your knees
Get in my mind
Get it out of my head
Get me out of my country
Get naked so naked
Get on my wife
Getting hungry
Getting laid
Getting lost and never getting lost
Getting married right away
Getting nervous
Getting no sleep
Getting nowhere’s all they want
Getting old
Getting out of the way
Getting the reins of power
Getting through all the pressure
Getting up right now
Gilded, beautiful country
Gimme candy
Gimme their melody
Give everything to somebody
Give it the name
Give it to me
Give me a chance
Give me more money
Give me my gun
Give me some beer
Give me something
Give me the name of John Doe
Give me time
Give me your love
Give me your precious words
Give me your tired-down
Give money away
Give the label
Give them time
Give up dreams
Give you no opportunity
Give you the hook
Give-tale
Gives you a good laugh
Giving into the fear
Giving it everything
Giving it my all
Giving you a lifetime's worth
Giving you no love
Glamorous looks
Glass
Glass leaves water
Glides down in his lap
Glowing from autumn
Glowing in your eyes
Glowing mist
Glowing sparks
Go ahead and drop me
Go ahead and run
Go away
Go back home
Go back, I'm the rain king
Go by my memory
Go down again
Go drown on the face
Go for the highroad
Go head to head
Go honey, this way
Go inside
Go on a date
Go through with you
Go throw it off
Go to heaven
Go to his place
God damn things
God damn you
God gave me so much
God is beautiful
God is gonna find me
God offered herself to me
God’s gonna watch
God’s sweet only within walls
Goes easy
Goes on my mind
Going all over
Going crazy
Going down
Going down the ways
Going down the white and red tunnels
Going for it
Going from sympathy
Going home
Going into war
Going on a dead end
Going on all the time
Going south
Going to die
Going to follow me around
Going to keep running
Going to watch
Going where no one else goes
Going wild
Gold in the evening
Golden
Golden in the sun
Golden towers
Gonna kill you
Gonna make us laugh
Gonna see how you want to work
Gonna show it off
Gonna upset your neighbour
Good at things
Good cop till the start
Good for an accent
Good for posterity
Good for you
Good girl
Good heavens
Good looking and beautiful
Good morning
Good mornings
Good night
Good night to you
Good things never happen
Good to get a kiss
Good to see
Good to sleep in
Good. Hand in hand with dreams
Goodbye
Goodbye really good
Goodbye winter
Goodnight

Got a chance to finally feel it
Got a face full of shit
Got a free ring
Got a lie
Got a little girl now
Got a sign
Got a tan
Got a true love album
Got a vision
Got a whole new chapter
Got all the demons
Got all these slippers
Got anyone watching?
Got everything?
Got her love
Got hit
Got hold of him
Got ideas
Got into it with you
Got it together
Got little toys
Got lots of money
Got no known room
Got no respect for him
Got no show
Got no time to lose
Got no trouble
Got nothing to do
Got on his face
Got paid
Got paper and a cup of tea
Got past it
Got sick of singing
Got some flowers to sell
Got the green paint
Got the phone tower
Got the weed up your arm
Got the wrong sound
Got to finish it
Got to make my point
Got up inside and ready for our son
Gotta send her home
Goze right through my shit
Grab a square
Grab up and wander
Grab your heart
Grabbing my money
Grabbing the freedom
Grandfathered to the gang
Grandma died as she sailed the sun
Great Light
Great beyond your being
Great butler
Great game
Great house
Great pair
Great save for your soul
Great scale
Great songs
Great thoughts
Great western smoke
Greatness you owe me
Green beer at the breakaway
Green fire
Green here, yellow there
Green light
Green mountains below
Green plays shotgun
Green walls
Green waves
Greeting me
Grew up
Grow old
Grow some bodies
Grow up and grow old
Grow up here
Grow up to become a complete man
Grown apart
Grown up fast
Grows away
Guilt won’t help you
Gully
Had a dream
Had another title
Had no father
Had no windows
Had the edge
Had to surrender
Haha
Hair
Half a dozen presidents
Half blind
Half empty
Half of my living room
Halt the world
Hand laid
Hand me a pencil
Hand me her sweet place
Hand-cuffed before we move on
Hand-to-hand combat
Hands on walls
Hang in there
Hang in there and stick by me
Hang it around
Hang on to me
Hang on!
Hang over me like a bat
Hang your hands together
Hanging in the bushes
Hanging in the mountains
Hanging on his head
Hanging over the pavement
Happy drinking
Happy tomorrow
Happy, satisfied, bliss
Hard and slow
Hard more like hell
Hard on my head
Hard on your face
Hard times
Hard to leave
Hark up a while ago
Harsh with empathy
Has to push it in
Hate came my way
Hate so many things
Hate ties the hood
Hate up on me
Hate, pity, hatred
Hated and saddled
Haunting me
Have a soul
Have all that oil and butter
Have become involved
Have got a plan
Have loved you
Have never seen the day
Have some excuses
Have the strength
Have you ever met a golden girl?
Hazing
He
He (a wild beast) needs a name
He always had a spare change
He always looked at me, made me watch
He always pointed a camera on me
He became sick once again
He calls me small
He can't lose anymore
He can't seem to walk alone
He can't stop me
He comes through
He could not help but shout
He couldn’t watch me
He cut inside
He died a fat man
He died like you all day
He died young
He dies for you
He doesze off
He gets from heartbreak
He goes to sleep
He got crazy
He has a mistress
He has no need for words
He hung around in his little town
He is the father
He just finished painting
He kept getting into my hair
He knew I was right
He knows who
He lied
He lives your loneliness
He looked like a picture
He looks around you
He lost sight of the day
He loved you
He loves her too
He made me love you
He made me sick
He may leave me alone
He might look fine and soft
He never said goodbye
He once gave it everything
He only a dream
He played me quite hard
He pushed a woman
He put it away
He put the special stains on his arm
He rides away
He rode all night
He said no
He said tomorrow, yeah?
He seems satisfied
He sits in awe
He sure looks like a hospital-girl
He thought I was wrong
He threw it on me
He told me
He turned my bedroom into a casino
He turned to the moon
He used his lonely desperation
He wakes me up
He was right
He was taking notes
He wasn't a cop
He won't be soon
He'd be proud of it
He'll know you’re wrong
He's got to win for her
He's got your eyes on him
He's inside me
He's just trying to understand
He's never said another word
He's nice as pitchfork
He's not afraid
He's started to quit
He's starting to quit
Head from the future
Head over heels
Head to the news
Head to the room
Headband worn over the hood
Headed the bank
Headfirst here
Heading away
Heading into somebody's life
Headlights shine
Heady little kids
Hear her scream
Hear it all over your shoulder
Hear me out
Hear me say
Hear me scream
Hear me shout
Hear me, all the time
Hear the sounds
Heard the sound of my footsteps
Heart bleeds
Heart here
Heart of my heart
Heart's so sweet
Heaven and earth are still moving
Heaven for her
Heaven will be under a row
Heavy armor
Heavy pressure
Heinz's lost his high
Hell and all’s fair
Hell isn't my soul
Hello
Hello darling
Hello everyone
Hello for a date
Hello from death
Hello real life
Hello there, hello there, honey baby
Hello universe
Hello, there it is!
Help me get out
Help me if they're looking for it
Help us after this is all over
Her God-given style
Her bag
Her band
Her beauty
Her body
Her boss is like a snake
Her custom guy
Her eyes turned green
Her hair is thicker and rich red
Her image comes on slowly
Her lungs go white
Her mind is here
Her miserable cry
Her new smoke time
Her parents flew around
Her roots are planted
Her throne
Her truck sashays her past
Her vision for new life
Here I am
Here I come
Here I come again
Here I go
Here I go again
Here I go new universe
Here I’m going to live again
Here at your place
Here comes healing
Here comes the jealous
Here comes the last story
Here comes your big brother
Here comes your talk
Here he comes
Here in a world full of shadows
Here in my city
Here in my side
Here is my friend
Here is the vision
Here it is, in your heart
Here she comes
Here she is
Here the skies fall
Here to see my tomorrow
Here to stay
Here tomorrow would be fine
Here we are
Here we are laugh
Here we come to swallow
Here we go
Here we go again
Here you are
Here you go again
Here's some news
Here's the place
Here's to you
Here's your girl
Hey Mama
Hey angel
Hey babe
Hey baby, what’s wrong?
Hey daddy
Hey go away
Hey let's make it stop
Hey look at it
Hey look at me
Hey look out there
Hey man
Hey momma
Hey rain on fire
Hey watch the singing
Hey, everyone right now
Hey, look at me and dance
Hey, nice view
Hey, what are you doing?
Hey, what's that really like?
Hey, you look good
Heyyyy you at the food hall
He’d take my life away
He’ll fly
He’ll get a roll
He’ll know what you know
He’s a blank slate
He’s a lifeline
He’s a shark
He’s a shock to behold
He’s alive
He’s all I ever wanted
He’s all yours
He’s already been awake in another dream
He’s already been wrong
He’s around
He’s being crazy
He’s brilliant
He’s broken
He’s fighting back
He’s getting one of them
He’s getting paid
He’s good to go
He’s had enough of hatred
He’s just another human being
He’s lost sight of me
He’s never a good excuse
He’s never gone
He’s not gonna like it anymore
He’s running away
He’s smart too
He’s taken my wallet
He’s the only guy to sleep
Hidden too hard
Hide in your wings
Hide the pathetic lie
Hide your braiding
Hide your soul
Hideaway
Hiding
Hiding behind our hopes
Hiding in plain sight
High above all
High and mighty
High in the morning
High on the crappie
High on the mountain
High priestly pose
Higher in my price
Higher with the sun
Higher-priority love
Hightime has arrived
Highway without my wand
His arms are tied in chains
His arms are warm
His body appears so immovable
His body is under fire
His dark guilt
His days are forever
His face’s hidden away
His false bravado
His feet are getting stashed away
His flesh overtakes his bones
His guiding hand
His habit of asking me if I got a look
His hair on the ground
His hand in mine
His hand is moving
His life's like a drug
His look was fatal
His love’s fine
His main feeder
His messianic grandeur
His mind went crazy
His missing pocket
His mouth is empty
His naked body
His name is Anna
His office
His sandalwood is unhangin'
His sips of poison
His tears won't die
His turn at last
Hit a saint
Hit me up again
Hit me with a brick
Hit the open flame
Hit the wall
Hold down that pistol
Hold it and watch it flow
Hold it close
Hold it together
Hold my hands
Hold on tight alrightie’s right
Hold your breath
Hold your hand
Hold your seat
Hold your tongue
Holds them down
Holy blows in the style
Holy chance
Holy gun
Holy it’s not holy it's clean’s straight
Holy men who’re dying
Holy shit
Holy trick
Holy virgin ocean
Holy, this is so wrong
Homeward
Honey
Honey wets a month
Honey, yes
Hook it up
Hooked in love
Hooking on the stars
Hooligans love me
Hope I found a better place
Hope I'll be around to add some perspective
Hopeless in search
Hoping for another day
Hoping for our sun to shine
Hoping for the wind
Hoping to cross the stars
Hoping to die
Hoping to get on your feet
Horses roll around on a bed
Hot lips
Hot master fuck
Hound her
How I feel whenever I feel dirty
How I grew up in America
How I had to sell my soul
How I ride
How I see you
How I'm looking for glory
How bad can it be?
How can you care?
How could I be dead here?
How could I possibly be apart
How could I possibly know
How could you know?
How could you?
How did he get here?
How did you know?
How do you know?
How do you say?
How easy it is
How easy it seems
How fucking nice you sound
How he always pretends he found her
How is my day
How it’s done
How long will it take?
How long will you hold on to my love
How lovely you can be
How many times do I have to eat?
How much I hate you
How she’d slip away
How soon will they fade
How the fire is cooking
How the memory wore on me
How they were made
How to beat that teacher
How to make you feel
How to survive on acid
How well you're doing
How you spoke
How you’ll be
How you’ll find my home
Huddled before the fire
Human beings can do nothing but watch
Human intercourse
Human trafficking
Hunger, I’m a bubble
Hungry Sunday
Hurry and pick away
Hurt
Hurt a girl
Hurt all the time
Hurt his emotion
Hurt my brother
Hurt you
I always got it wrong
I always took my kiss
I am a big fan
I am a broken statue
I am awake
I am desperate to get out of here
I am going nowhere
I am here now
I am inside
I am not happy
I am sorry, I need to get away
I am still in your ways
I am strong
I am wondering
I am your spirit
I believe I’m making a mess
I believe it
I believe it but I ain't sure who
I believe that for some reason
I believe you
I came to save you
I can barely move
I can be an old man
I can be as much as I want
I can burn ourselves up
I can dance naked
I can feel it rising
I can feel it stalking behind me
I can feel this tension
I can feel you’re close to getting high
I can fly over the stars
I can help you
I can hold my own
I can lay back
I can look and feel
I can never be good
I can see it now
I can see my guard out
I can see the memories
I can see the sun shining
I can see you crying
I can see you turning
I can see you’ve got you
I can talk to you easily
I can tell him shit
I can tell you how to kiss her
I can't help it
I can't move
I can't take it anymore
I cannot be seen
I cannot believe this
I cannot wait to find out what you say
I cannot write this goodbye
I can’t be shy
I can’t control what I see
I can’t get used to my existence
I can’t go on until they see
I can’t hide behind
I can’t let you go
I can’t play jagged walls
I can’t say with any certainty
I can’t survive without you
I can’t tell what to say
I can’t understand why
I can’t wait till he’s gone
I can’t wait to see you
I can’t watch
I care about you
I come from such a place
I could feel her tongue tingle
I could feel you all around me
I could get tired
I could go
I could make you be so good
I could only laugh
I could teach you later
I did say that
I didn't care about you
I didn't dance
I didn't know what it was
I didn't need to be bothered
I didn't want to say anything
I didn’t know what I was doing
I didn’t look so damn cute
I died
I died for you
I do feel better
I do not hate you
I do not know who you are
I don't know why
I don't know why you are here
I don't know why you’ve done it?
I don't like them
I don't like this
I don't need you anymore
I don't want anyone else to know
I don't want you to know
I don't want you to lie
I don’t care how old you are
I don’t care to be
I don’t care what he’s doing
I don’t care what you say
I don’t care where it’s headed
I don’t get it now
I don’t have much left to say
I don’t have my future
I don’t know
I don’t know if you were good or evil
I don’t know what else
I don’t know who I’m gonna belong to
I don’t look pretty
I don’t love you
I don’t mean to judge
I don’t mind it
I don’t need it’s alright
I don’t need to watch it last forever
I don’t need you
I don’t see that coming
I don’t see why it is said?
I don’t understand why you’re dying
I don’t wanna be anybody else
I don’t want to be his friend
I don’t want to be you
I don’t want to be your friend
I don’t want to stay here
I don’t want your memory
I do…
I fear not
I feel I’m doomed
I feel a burning sensation
I feel alive
I feel down
I feel free
I feel fucked
I feel good
I feel hurt and bitter
I feel invincible
I feel kinda bad because I didn't
I feel like I’m being purged
I feel like a band of crazy thugs
I feel like it’s time to say goodbye
I feel like nobody knows
I feel my own sweetness
I feel myself falling apart
I feel rotten
I feel scarred
I feel sick
I feel so bad for you
I feel so broken
I feel the need to tell you
I feel the pressure of all the stars
I feel you’re in danger
I feel... my love
I fell for the mavens
I find love
I find myself working
I fought like a devil
I found an way to get in
I found myself so satisfied
I found somebody safe
I found something special
I found you alive
I gave it to you in the rain
I get around from where you got to
I get it
I get tired of watching you
I got a gourd
I got it going
I got some pretty sick cutie mark
I got to come with you
I gotta be with you
I gotta finish him
I gotta make friends
I gotta say that
I gotta shake my world apart
I grew too old
I grew up around being scared
I grew up in an echo
I grew up on earth
I grew up watching you’re all right
I guess so
I guess they had a clue
I had a dream the other day
I had been living
I had met him
I had their accent
I had to know
I had to take care of my business
I hate having to be alone
I hate it
I hate my father
I have a crush
I have a secret soul
I have been dying for so long
I have met my mother
I have no new money
I have no trouble seeing
I hear the singing
I hear you talk
I heard something strange
I hope she won't survive
I hope we'll be together soon
I hope you stay right next door
I hope you won’t care
I just came for you
I just can't fucking do it
I just can't seem to get away
I just feel like I’m giving in
I just get why
I just live in a bubble
I just love you
I just met her
I just need a teacher
I just wanna sleep
I just want to watch the streetlights shift
I keep disappearing
I keep getting pleasure
I keep going
I keep growing
I keep my life to myself
I keep your hand so close
I kept going up
I kept her some distance
I knew
I knew he’d die
I knew she was mine
I knew you’d come
I know everything
I know it was the last time
I know it’s evening
I know it’s got nothing to do
I know it’s you
I know my life is over
I know now
I know she said
I know she’d not
I know that
I know what my name is
I know what you mean
I know when I can’t tell
I know where I'm at
I know where this artist is at
I know your dreams
I know you’re fine
I know you’re me
I know you’ve seen
I know, I love you
I like it cold
I like it too
I lived a nightmare
I looked at you’ve never seen
I looked down into the deep ocean
I looked down on my troubled youth
I looked it up
I lost my sight
I love him
I love it
I love it so much
I love making mistakes
I love you forever
I love you like I love myself
I love you so much
I love you too
I love you, sweetie
I loved you
I made a friend out
I made myself home
I make mistakes
I may make you feel bad
I mean all of us
I mean my name is again
I mean the time and place
I mean these things
I mean to tell you a secret
I mean what is on your mind
I met his father
I miss you
I missed you
I must make her feel good
I need somebody to love
I need the things
I need to close the window
I need you
I need you to do this
I need your help
I need you’ve built me a secret dream
I never did it right
I never gave you a chance
I never got a chance
I never knew him
I never know
I never know who you are
I never saw you like this before
I never spoke to you
I never talked to the boy
I never thought of it so
I never took that road
I never understood the blindness
I only care where I am from
I only see you once
I only watch you naked
I owe you nothing
I owe your money
I remember this dream
I sat alone
I saw a book’s starting to come out
I saw a sunrise
I saw it for weeks
I saw my mother
I saw she led me inside
I saw the power behind you
I saw the world
I saw you get ready
I saw you through
I say I can put away all that sadness
I say don't keep out
I say to myself that we’re all friends
I say you don't show
I say, I want to know
I see a silver lining
I see her hands on my shoulder
I see no enemy
I see through all of your sorrow
I see through your window
I see you alright
I see you instead
I see you shine
I see you’re a wise man
I shall move from him
I should feel free
I should get some friends in my band
I should try
I sing the blues
I started out as you do
I still can’t seem to look at it
I still don’t have the holy order
I still feel pity
I still got it
I still have dreams
I still talk at night
I take a fall
I take all of my notes
I take you down
I take your hand
I tell you
I tell you what to believe
I think
I think I am
I think I just sank
I think I need sex
I think I was alone
I think I'm gonna be okay
I think I’ve been getting kicked
I think he says it's for your cup of tea
I think he’ll tell me
I think it is all good
I think it's time to go?
I think my own problems
I think she's got a soul
I think someone laid down
I think that could be cool
I think you don’t belong here
I think you have another hand
I think you’re well?
I thought I was going to die
I thought it was Jesus
I thought it was poison
I thought she didn't exist
I thought you were
I thought you were dead
I took him to war
I took out my mitts
I took pity from you
I took you
I took your sword
I turned up to meet you
I use a coffin
I use my voice
I used to hang around here
I used to stay out of sight
I used to tell her so
I walk
I walk past you
I walked away
I walked down this road
I wanna eat your trash
I wanna feel okay
I wanna go alive
I wanna kill you
I wanna see
I wanna show you how
I want her lovingly taken away
I want my mind to wander
I want something from you
I want the world to know
I want to be golden
I want to change everything
I want to go home
I want to kill you
I want to see you now
I want to stay in this town
I want you
I want you all to think about
I want you there
I want you to be my friend
I want you to love me
I wanted to cry
I wanted you to keep quiet
I was afraid of him
I was born into the curse
I was born to ask you
I was born to pass my time
I was going through all these shows
I was going to hell
I was new to the job
I was of glass
I was one time
I was right
I was so fucked with fucking power
I was tired of thinking
I wasn't dead
I wasn't thinking for six weeks
I went down
I went home
I went to sleep watching
I will always be there
I will be fine
I will be forever
I will be sorry
I will be you
I will be your role model
I will beat you on the ass
I will feel
I will keep you
I will move forwards
I will move inside
I will never stop
I will not forget
I will pass away
I will pass this point
I will return
I will ruin this music
I will see
I will serve you
I will shake
I will show you where it feels right
I will stay on them
I will take care of you
I wish you were here
I won't blame you for anything
I won't feel good
I won't feel the pain anymore
I wonder how many bars there are?
I wonder how?
I wonder the future
I wonder what lives in that hell?
I wonder what?
I wonder what’s on my mind?
I wonder why
I won’t cry out
I won’t die in vain
I won’t go
I won’t look on you
I won’t take credit
I won’t tell
I won’t touch
I would have wanted
I ’m driving away from you
I ’m not afraid to die
I'd never lose it
I'd try to become Miss America
I'll be there every day
I'll die by your hand
I'll do the same for you
I'll feel so comfortable
I'll get into it with a beat
I'll go and beat you down
I'll go outside
I'll go to the bathroom
I'll introduce you
I'll kill you
I'll miss you
I'll never make you pay
I'll play some good games
I'll stay a while longer
I'll take a girl if she calls you
I'll understand
I'll use your friends
I'm a bird
I'm a savior
I'm a shame
I'm afraid of this world
I'm afraid she’d go
I'm afraid you’ll take me
I'm almost at the start
I'm almost feeling the beat
I'm away
I'm close to dying
I'm coming back tomorrow
I'm coming home
I'm doing it wrong
I'm dying
I'm feeling so fucking hungry
I'm feeling so good
I'm fine with it
I'm free
I'm getting tired
I'm going out for a dance
I'm going to kick the butt
I'm going to meet you
I'm gonna be tomorrow
I'm gonna kill you
I'm having the time of my life
I'm hearing your voice
I'm home tonight
I'm hungry
I'm just stuck behind
I'm looking right at you
I'm lying
I'm not crying
I'm not even a job
I'm not even comfortable
I'm not going to do it right here
I'm not satisfied
I'm on top
I'm outta here
I'm right beside you
I'm so sorry
I'm so worried
I'm so wrong
I'm sorry
I'm still afraid
I'm supposed to move heaven
I'm tired
I'm watching my lover sleep
I'm well, but stay away
I've got no time for it
I've got so many sights on me
I've got something
I've lost all respect for you
I've made your pretty name?
I've seen no reason to think
Ice across the sky
Ice cream and kiss you
Ice cream from the top
If I can keep you
If I die tomorrow
If I walked it in
If I’ve never worked
If anyone did
If he brings it back tomorrow
If he ever flew
If it could love you
If it takes you some more time
If it’s Sunday morning
If it’s a miracle
If it’s fucking broken
If my money can't feed me
If only there were a trade
If only you could see
If only you had died
If she tried on his clothes
If the cloud
If the mice still live inside
If the spirits of the dying could stand at my feet
If the sun shines on me
If they’re looking forward
If we all die
If we used her
If we were angels
If you can never get lost
If you cast me on the wings
If you could all pass
If you don't care for me
If you don’t like it
If you don’t want to take advantage
If you get sick of me
If you grow up with art
If you have
If you meet me for love
If you scream and cry as I say
If you seem like me
If you stayed here
If you survive this phase
If you think you are
If you want a slice of the night
If you want to know
If you were breathing
If you wish
If you’re bringing it home
If you’re bringing me through
If you’re still all alive
Im a idiot
Im not sure who to look for
Im tired of staying where I am
Im with you
Imagine my eyes
Imagine the shock
Immediate triumph
Immolate yourself
Immortal
Impress her
Imprint the planet
In a big room
In a bubble
In a clear room
In a dream
In a flash
In a foreign land
In a hurry
In a lost tongue
In a room with a bar
In a secret corner
In a thousand different ways
In all the glory of his face
In an all-inclusive chapter
In and out
In another world
In between our lines
In darkness
In every pose
In glory
In heaven
In her stormy New York days
In her way
In his anger
In his passing
In his rage
In honour of the past
In hope we will burn in hell
In isolation
In it I came
In it we run, walking distance
In jail cell
In love
In love with a person
In most of the books
In my care
In my dream
In my head
In my opinion
In my shoes
In my ways
In order to remain sane
In our battle-lines
In our shame
In ruins
In shackled words
In song
In such a big way
In tears
In the band
In the book
In the bottom of the sea
In the crossroads
In the dark
In the depths
In the evening
In the fields
In the fog
In the form of a split second
In the game of life
In the gate
In the ground
In the heart of the city
In the high air
In the hospital
In the interest of full harmony
In the interest of my son
In the interest of playing along
In the land of snakes
In the middle of the desert
In the midst of her glory
In the midst of suffering
In the minds of the law
In the moments of contempt
In the narrow courtyard
In the new space
In the only space between men
In the open you must be a guest
In the present
In the room
In the safety of the Holy Grail
In the same room
In the shadow of the ring
In the snow
In the street
In the sunlight
In the ten-cent battle
In the test case
In the thick of the day
In the time when I was unearthly
In their blood and sweat
In there
In this day and age
In this room
In this sandpit place
In this windy time
In time
In true dance
In truth
In white?
In your blood now
In your heart
In your mind
In your place
In your sadness
In your stomach
In your youth
Inaing indecision
Incentive shows
Incoming powerful waves
Infiltrate you
Inherited by fate
Inside I fear
Inside a moth
Inside locked out
Inside my heart
Inside of you
Inside the box
Inside the dream
Inside the sanctum sanctorum
Inspiration flying through your veins
Inspiration in the sky
Inspiration, revelation
Inspire you
Inspiring all your life
Instant and dying
Instead of breaking, beat, bend
Instinctive devotions
Intense emotion
Intense pleasure
Inter-generational timeframe
Intergalactic relations
Interlude after another day
Interminable mental play
Into a world that was only outside
Into an empty scene
Into it
Into silence
Into the chaos
Into the dark
Into the glow
Into the hearts of men
Into the human world
Into the jungle
Into the lonely water
Into the truth
Into this world
Into your cup of tea
Intrigue of innocence
Invades the halls
Invent the new fable
Invented
Invite your family
Iron and steel
Iron food
Iron hand now
Iron hands, ghost of a dream
Iron hangs on shelves
Iron on the silver line
Irony
Irritating dreamers
Is buried far away
Is everybody crying?
Is everybody doing it?
Is everything good?
Is gonna be rain by the boat
Is he free?
Is he starting to catch fire?
Is it for you?
Is it okay if it just keeps saying so?
Is it okay to be where you are
Is it running here?
Is not the right way
Is that it?
Is the thing without you here?
Is this a dream?
Is this all just silly?
Is this brother an enemy of mine?
Isn't it better for everybody to be safe?
Isn't it black?
Isn't she going to make it this way?
Isn't the only thing that matters
Isn't this just a game show
It ain't hard enough
It ain't looking good
It ain't wrong
It brings a smile
It came out his skin and talked to me
It could be a vice
It didn't look like you’re there
It feels like a dream
It feels so nice
It gets you down
It had come with it
It is all behind you
It is broken
It is called earth
It is over
It is such a waste of time
It just happened
It keeps your hot lips from looking wild
It looks like I’ve arrived
It makes me so lonely
It makes my skin feel warm
It never leaves me
It really hurts me
It shouldn't be so much like that
It takes a village
It takes him down
It took her by surprise
It took me from living out with my mind
It took me years to lose
It was a pain to bear
It was just yesterday
It was like I had been shooting
It was never mine
It was off to the races
It was only natural
It was so true
It was the night before
It was written in sorrow
It wasn't a dream
It will bring out the devil
It will grow at the top
It will make you think
It won't take long to sing
It's a good place
It's all you
It's cold here
It's easier to be a light
It's fucking violent
It's getting cold up in the morning
It's going to be awful
It's gonna stay with you
It's hard to find
It's just way over your head
It's like a train of sickle pals
It's like leaving you alone
It's mine
It's never good
It's not…it’s not right
It's obvious
It's over now
It's pretty too good to be true
It's probably so cold now
It's slow for you
It's so hard
It's so heavenly
It's the Devil
Its a hell of a fight
It’s a cliché
It’s a corner
It’s a crime
It’s a duel
It’s a girl
It’s a kind of beast
It’s a little bit less than here
It’s a merry dance
It’s a pretty girl in a dirty hotel
It’s a prison
It’s about here
It’s all about fear
It’s all about them
It’s all his fault
It’s all life or nothing
It’s all wonderful
It’s almost endless
It’s almost time for a Christmas tree
It’s an acrid day
It’s an act
It’s an idol
It’s as if the world has no end
It’s awful
It’s bad enough
It’s beautiful
It’s been going on forever
It’s boring
It’s cold here
It’s crazy how bad it gets
It’s easy to roll in love
It’s fine
It’s fucked up
It’s fucking alive
It’s getting late
It’s half men
It’s hard to finish
It’s hard to hide
It’s hard to name
It’s his pleasure
It’s illegal
It’s just down the line
It’s just like me
It’s just me
It’s just plain terrible
It’s my dream
It’s my son
It’s nice to be around
It’s nice to be around you
It’s not a good thing
It’s not like that’s right
It’s not like you've ever seen me
It’s not my night
It’s not worth it
It’s not wrong
It’s not your fault
It’s okay
It’s okay to make mistakes
It’s one of the biggest lies
It’s only fair
It’s out of habit
It’s really not fair
It’s ridiculous
It’s so easy
It’s some nostalgia joke
It’s still you and me
It’s time for the great game
It’s time for the moon
It’s time for the stable
It’s time for you
It’s time to go home
It’s time to lay down
It’s too late
It’s tough on her
It’s true
It’s unmade
It’s what I’ve been through
It’s wonderful
It’s your mouth
It’s your record
I’ll always be my lover
I’ll be a pig
I’ll be able to
I’ll be alive every day
I’ll be by you
I’ll be cool
I’ll be fine and right
I’ll be glad I don’t go now
I’ll be in prison
I’ll be okay
I’ll be sick
I’ll be so damn tired
I’ll be sober
I’ll be tomorrow
I’ll be your mother
I’ll burn your eyes
I’ll cry out loud
I’ll drown in you
I’ll fill your space
I’ll find out
I’ll find you
I’ll get you something
I’ll give you peace
I’ll give you something
I’ll go in my father's shadow
I’ll have to be a liar
I’ll just ask why
I’ll keep shooting
I’ll kick your ass a thousand times
I’ll live in his statue
I’ll lose you
I’ll move on
I’ll need you to be
I’ll never be satisfied
I’ll never find
I’ll never find love
I’ll never look my best again
I’ll never meet you
I’ll never stay
I’ll never stay, forever
I’ll never touch it
I’ll not keep my head out of the water
I’ll pass
I’ll pray for your soft affections
I’ll put you on your ass
I’ll put you to sleep
I’ll see you when I grow up
I’ll show you what it means
I’ll start another job
I’ll throw them the punch
I’ll throw you away
I’ll use them to change my mind
I’m a bit uneasy
I’m a boy
I’m a busybody
I’m a hero
I’m a little sickened
I’m a walking dead
I’m about to catch my breath
I’m about to dive in
I’m about to set down
I’m alive
I’m alive in front of the mirror
I’m all things to get
I’m almost awake
I’m almost done
I’m alone
I’m always cold
I’m always late
I’m always like this
I’m always on you
I’m an electric driver
I’m an old man
I’m at home
I’m beyond attraction
I’m blind
I’m busy getting here
I’m busy restlessly
I’m changing a life
I’m cold and lonely
I’m coming so far
I’m doing nothing
I’m done with them
I’m dying of envy
I’m feeling good
I’m feeling sorry for you
I’m feeling tired
I’m finally awake
I’m fine
I’m fine with it
I’m fine with the fleshy paper
I’m floating down
I’m forgetting everything
I’m fucking alone
I’m getting close
I’m getting colder
I’m getting down
I’m getting great at painting
I’m getting high
I’m getting jealous
I’m getting old
I’m giving away something to anyone
I’m glad they’re gone
I’m going nowhere
I’m going to be so sick
I’m going to give you a crack
I’m going to live like nobody knows
I’m gonna be home
I’m gonna break out tonight
I’m gonna die
I’m gonna find my tomb
I’m gonna join
I’m gonna quit
I’m gonna ruin your life
I’m gonna stay
I’m got a vision
I’m happy
I’m here
I’m here so suddenly
I’m here to help
I’m here to say
I’m here to stay
I’m here to take you apart
I’m home
I’m impatient
I’m inside
I’m just getting more
I’m just taking your life away
I’m just turning my corner
I’m just wearing my bare feet
I’m keeping you
I’m leaving
I’m leaving it at home
I’m locked in
I’m locked up
I’m lonely
I’m looking at you
I’m looking to move tomorrow
I’m making it so easy
I’m making music
I’m meant to be
I’m mine
I’m moving too slowly
I’m naked inside
I’m never going nowhere
I’m never going to pick up my shoes
I’m not all wrong
I’m not crazy
I’m not crying
I’m not doing it for her
I’m not looking through the day
I’m not so sure
I’m not your boss
I’m of the future
I’m okay with it
I’m old
I’m on the move
I’m once again wrong
I’m out of everything
I’m pretty
I’m ready for this
I’m ready to sing
I’m really loving you
I’m really, really tired
I’m scared
I’m scared I’m gonna see
I’m sick to death
I’m so glad you're here
I’m sorry for every little thing
I’m sorry you’re stuck
I’m standing here
I’m standing inside
I’m standing on the white corridor
I’m standing there
I’m still lonely
I’m still scared
I’m still young
I’m stuck
I’m supposed to find you
I’m taking over
I’m the devil
I’m the fucking cloud
I’m the little boy
I’m the same
I’m the wrong one
I’m tired
I’m tired of this threesome
I’m torn
I’m trying to be normal
I’m very sad
I’m weary
I’m wrong
I’m young
I’m your friend
I’m your pride
I’m’d be satisfied
I’ve been dead forever
I’ve been ignored
I’ve been lifted
I’ve been one for a long time
I’ve been promised
I’ve been waiting so long
I’ve been watching you for hours
I’ve done fine
I’ve found life
I’ve gone through so many
I’ve got a resolution
I’ve got a special girl
I’ve got all the wind in my sails
I’ve got no interest
I’ve got no match
I’ve got you right
I’ve lost my mind
I’ve made a dream
I’ve met you
I’ve never had a love sound
I’ve never known
I’ve never seen anyone talk
I’ve never seen anything like it
I’ve never seen your face
I’ve only got one thought
I’ve seen a boy
I’ve seen my father
I’ve seen way too much
I’ve seen you crying
I’ve spent my life crying
I’ve spent the last century stranded alone
Jealousy like a girl
Jesus Christ
Jesus invented the birth control pill
Jesus said
Jesus talks it over
Jesus would go
Jesus' wheel that turns purple
Jet fish eyes
Johnny
Join in my dance
Join me
Join me in his arms
Join me today
Join me tonight
Join me, I need you
Join our long and happy day
Join the battle
Join the carnival
Join the dance
Join with me
Join your sister
Jump backwards - I see you’re so beautiful
Jump down the fucking hill
Jump for it
Jump in the cage
Jump on our heels
Jump on this girl
Jump over to the people
Jumped too high
Just I know
Just a beautiful parade
Just a blue sky
Just a dream
Just a friendly lie
Just a friendly smile
Just a little bit longer
Just a passing topper
Just a regular guy
Just a small fan
Just a thought
Just about to swallow
Just after me
Just after noon
Just another day
Just another day ahead
Just another fake
Just another roof
Just another sad little animal
Just as I found you
Just as she will talk
Just be together for a month
Just be yourself
Just broken up like shit
Just fine
Just follow my heart
Just follow your dreams
Just for a name
Just for fun
Just for you
Just found the company
Just get me out
Just get me through this one
Just hang out and have fun
Just hide your hands
Just his friends
Just how a world will end
Just keep away
Just known
Just leaves the future unlocked
Just like an old soul
Just like in the movies
Just like me
Just like the average lothario
Just like the body can never catch
Just like yesterday
Just listening to her
Just look at you
Just looking for you
Just make it known
Just making it more like a city
Just me
Just mind you, all by myself
Just mine
Just moving in
Just now and then
Just one more chance to turn
Just open your eyes
Just out of fear
Just out of habit
Just pay more attention
Just plain stupid
Just putting it down
Just putting up this girl
Just roll over to sleep
Just saying
Just share it
Just simply higher
Just so I know what you think
Just so you know
Just staying awake
Just taking some time to look
Just teach me
Just the gate
Just the way I feel
Just the week before my daydream
Just thinking about it
Just to calm down
Just to pull the strings
Just to see you’ve said this before
Just to take you by your arm
Just to tell
Just to try and keep the honeymoon quiet
Just to wake us up
Just try to turn the pages
Just waiting for the break
Just walk around
Just walk in the sound
Just wander your free ways
Just wanna catch him if you can
Just want to help
Just want you to know
Just watch their skin crawl
Just watched your life changing
Just what she got
Just you
Katherine of the suburbs
Keep away from your friends
Keep doing it
Keep going
Keep her as a name
Keep his cool
Keep inside
Keep making promises to the people
Keep me in your house
Keep me still
Keep my lips flowing
Keep on running
Keep the power fresh
Keep their heart from me
Keep to the shore
Keep your secrets
Keeping it quiet
Keeps our feet wet
Keeps you free
Kicking the barrel
Kicking the clown
Kids can look at you
Kill her words
Kill me in your hand
Kill the beautiful
Kill the bird
Kill the dude
Kill the memories
Kill the typhoon
Killing a boat
Killing all that nobody’s understanding
Killing me
Killing rainbows
Killing the enemies
Killing the kindness
Kinda suicidal
King blows
King of the dance floors
Kiss in my mouth
Kissed into my cheek
Kissed my heart
Kissing every last one
Kissing her with pen and heart
Kissing sky
Kitted out for You
Knew he was crazy
Knife through my stomach
Knock it dead
Knock on doors
Knock on the doors
Know every stitch
Know how things are from now on
Know not who I am
Know that nobody’s watching
Know the only way you know
Know where they are
Know where to go
Know who cares
Know you’ll call
Know you’re a friend
Lady kneels for me
Lady of the seven seas
Lady sings
Lady someday
Lady who won’t let me die
Lady's hand prints
Ladybird, blind man's sweetheart
Lady’s trembling
Lapping your feet
Larking at the stars
Last
Last fall
Last night I walked inside
Last night in hell
Last, glorious and holy
Late one evening
Late to the party
Lately
Laugh and roll
Laugh at that rock star
Laugh in our faces
Laugh in the face of every belief
Laughing and crying every day
Laughing at the static
Laughing cross free
Laughing in my head
Laughing over all the problems
Laughs in the east
Lay claim to fame
Lay dead
Lay down
Lay down on top of the mountain
Lay the bag
Lead a singing flight
Lead by a light
Lead me home
Lead off with love
Lead out the windows
Lean for a walk
Lean forward and hard
Lean on me
Learn about the law
Learn how to play
Learn me what I know
Learn some American history
Learn to survive
Learn to treat the girl
Leave a good word
Leave behind that rotten day
Leave her alone
Leave her out of reach
Leave him alone
Leave it on my mind
Leave it there
Leave it to them
Leave it with me
Leave me or I shall become a law
Leave me to meet your ladies
Leave the light on
Leave them cold
Leave to dance
Leave you desolate
Leaves the cut
Leaves your friend at the window
Leaving me young
Left my back to the ground
Left of you
Left to our own devices
Lest we keep flying through the sky
Let a day pass
Let alone beat it
Let go
Let her sing
Let him be king
Let him see why
Let it be
Let it be here
Let it be that way
Let it come down
Let it come to pass
Let it down
Let it out
Let me be
Let me be your queen
Let me die
Let me feel your arms
Let me go
Let me go wild
Let me hide from you
Let me just have a moment
Let me let you know
Let me look at this
Let me reach for you
Let me say it again
Let me stop
Let me tell you about it
Let me try out
Let the breath of success run
Let the golden age begin
Let the news stand
Let the pain escape
Let the scene hold us forever
Let the wolves off the trees
Let the world tremble
Let them call me weary
Let them find you
Let us all rise
Let us be
Let us follow
Let us hide in our halls
Let us know
Let us make a new world
Let you become satisfied
Let you see tomorrow
Let your heart beat
Let your loving heart dance
Let your pet
Let's be friends
Let's do that
Let's face it
Let's get going
Let's get round of it
Let's get there
Let's get to life
Let's go
Let's go back to our place
Let's go dance
Let's go down to Stonewall Cafeteria
Let's go over again
Let's go where the hell we belong
Let's have your movies
Let's just get a fancy little gig
Let's just kick the door down
Let's keep ourselves apart
Let's kick your ass
Let's meet again
Let's not be afraid
Let's not forget that
Let's not waste any time
Let's put you in this body
Let's reach for their dead
Let's see how you look
Let's see what comes
Let's show what kind of hate we are
Let's take the earth
Let's take this from the heart
Let's talk rainbows
Letting a man down
Letting fly
Letting your powers slip
Let’s finish now
Let’s say okay
Let’s stop it
Lie down in a room
Lie full face to true
Lie in silence
Lie is a curse
Lie so tight
Lies in an alley
Lies my mind
Lies that you’ve put in your mind
Life
Life - all you had but one floor
Life being nothing but service
Life can play a role in my destiny
Life in terror
Life is a trick
Life is about to get late
Life is fine
Life is full of deeds
Life is just like your mind
Life is old and cold
Life is pretty much the high priest
Life is running so slow
Life is safe
Life is small
Life loves a band
Life on the line
Life or death
Life was there
Life's too precious
Life-changing
Light sweet things
Light that hangs in the ceiling
Light up the pages
Light, and low
Lighthearted attitude
Lightning of a candle
Lights down now
Lights for me
Lights out from us
Like I said
Like I say
Like I should be
Like I’m a trap
Like a beam on a pillow
Like a dream
Like a few broken bottles
Like a girl
Like a miracle
Like a mistress
Like a nest of snakes
Like a newspaper story
Like a phoenix
Like a silver wheel
Like always
Like an angel
Like an idol
Like back in his days
Like bandits
Like buried fire
Like china
Like dreams
Like drinking water
Like drowning in the street
Like flowing colours
Like he said
Like heaven and hell
Like he’s a lunatic
Like holy water
Like it’s good to see
Like magic
Like my life is a dream
Like my little bones
Like no other
Like running across the skyline
Like shit
Like that she goes slow
Like the future
Like the king
Like the shadows
Like the sound of a time machine
Like the wonder of love
Like time for the wind
Like tomorrow
Like underwater
Like you all
Like you got confused
Like you think you know
Like your mind is me
Lines blurred
Lips of war
Listen on my ear
Lit it off
Literal shit
Little Daisy dreams
Little Paulie maybe?
Little brain
Little devil, you’re a rising star
Little ears of a good laugh
Little evil
Little girl
Little girl dreaming
Little hands lead me down to the banks
Little idol
Little ironic kid
Little pictures of you
Little precious stone
Little red hills
Little sensation
Little sister
Little startling
Live a different way
Live a life with me
Live a little longer
Live and die like kings
Live for a moment
Live for him
Live for my virgin year
Live forever in the sky
Live happily ever after
Live in harmony
Live like fools
Live your dreams
Live your life
Live your life safely
Living as you seem before
Living in a lonely place
Living in misery
Living in the shadows
Living on the edge
Living this life
Living through misery
Living to the shame
Living under fire
Lock in when someone leaves
Locked in
Locked in my mind
Locked in this shell
Locked inside a cell
Locked into your mouth
Locked my bed
Locked up all night
Locked within my soul
Loneliness can be everywhere
Lonely and lonely
Lonely are the lights of the earth
Lonely face
Lonely keep waiting
Lonely souls?
Lonely wakes of my lovelorn world
Long ago, you know
Long alone
Long and dead
Long before I grow old
Long daylight
Long distance train ride
Long golden days
Long hair’s a decent route
Long live the innocent
Long live, I’m one
Long noonday
Long on room service
Long overdue
Long overdue redemption
Long reach in the cloud
Long time same
Long, thin drift
Longtime commitment
Longtime enemy
Look around
Look at my feet
Look at that smile
Look at the snake like you’ve never seen
Look at this frail creature
Look out for me
Look through your eyes
Look what you did when you took care of me
Look where I could fly
Lookin' for somebody else
Looking around at the universe
Looking at the records
Looking at the sky
Looking at the stars
Looking at the things people do
Looking at you crying
Looking at you now
Looking at you on a dark and rainy night
Looking back in the dark
Looking down
Looking down on me
Looking down on you
Looking for a good night
Looking for a reason
Looking for me
Looking for my springtime
Looking for somebody
Looking for something new
Looking for something to say
Looking for the anchor
Looking for your side
Looking for you’s last minute overture
Looking in the future
Looking in the mirror
Looking inside
Looking out for myself
Looking out for you
Looking over you
Looking over your shoulder
Looking through the window
Looking to the south
Looks for nothing but luck
Looks like you
Lord No
Lord of paint
Lord of rage
Lord of years
Lose faith
Lose me
Lose your leisure
Losing control over my body
Losing him
Lost - lost
Lost a thousand
Lost all control
Lost all my nerve
Lost another girl
Lost for a century
Lost from existence
Lost in the stars
Lost in you
Lost innocence
Lost it
Lost it in your dreams
Lost it up
Lost life
Lost little worlds
Lost love in shadows
Lost my faith
Lost the hope
Lost the line
Lost the stars
Lost them all
Lost there
Lost time watching rain on television
Lost- of our nation
Lovable silver inside you
Love Is falling apart
Love all the feelings
Love always rest
Love and danger
Love and redemption
Love and show me that
Love and whatever you do
Love becomes foreign
Love for life
Love for the soul
Love from the saddle
Love hearts fill their temples
Love hurts
Love in your bones
Love is a poison
Love is a thousand different beasts
Love is at stake
Love is born here
Love is dead
Love is funny
Love is like an old brother
Love is made on the ground
Love is my life
Love is your own laws
Love loses a big shot
Love me a bit
Love me some fruit
Love me this much
Love my kid
Love of mine
Love of pain
Love opens new doors
Love reminds me
Love reminds us
Love sells
Love stick me like a stick of nails
Love still burns
Love that the ground changes colors
Love the book
Love the highway
Love to cause sorrow
Love will send words
Love with all your own pieces
Love you and hate you
Love your heart
Love's all too real
Love's onto you
Love, love, love
Lovely gunboat
Lovely times
Loving a miracle
Loving and trying to teach
Low lying noise
Low on sweetness
Low paying job
Lowest room
Lucky charm
Lucky for you
Lucky guy
Lucky in need
Lucky to have you in my life
Lucky you
Lying
Lying for a while
Lying in the sun
Lying in your nightmare
Lying silent
Mad and miserable
Made a bargain
Made a bridge of silence
Made an ancient image
Made fun of me
Made it feel great
Made love to the devil
Made me feel
Made me the enemy
Made of powder
Made of steel
Made of white paint
Made out
Made out really lousy
Made the center of the lot
Made through a mountain
Made to fight to make it so
Made to move
Made to sound rock'n'roll
Made up tales
Made with no vision
Made you cry
Made your bones like a trumpet
Made your promises
Madeleine from ours
Make a deal with you
Make a friendly peace
Make a matter of it
Make a new fucking world
Make it better
Make it neat
Make it out of the blue
Make it sweet
Make me believe
Make me believe in you
Make me crazy
Make me forget
Make me glad
Make my boy question
Make no mistake
Make noise
Make peace with your enemies
Make some nice ladies day
Make something new
Make the world nice
Make those sounds just a little further away
Make up a story
Make us laugh
Make way
Make your mind a hundred shapes
Make your own yellow people
Make your sun flow
Make yourself sad
Makes me a little scratch
Makes me sad
Makes me so stupid
Makes you feel comfortable
Makes you feel so much better
Makes you say goodbye
Makes you so happy
Makes your bed empty
Makeup white
Making a pyre
Making fun of anybody
Making love
Making love again
Making love to a dead lover
Making my way through the crowd
Man down
Man in shining armour
Man next door
Man's way
Man, tell me your way
Man-made chaos
Many a lost look
Many are brave
Many birds over again
Many of the times the truth hangs
Many people on top
Many years ago
Man’s got an oneness
Marching inside of our dreams
Marching to see stars
Mashed in holy hell
Master, crazy
Match your mind
May God help me
May I stay like this?
May be a prize
May come if you need me
May fall apart
May take my heart
Maybe I can find the light
Maybe I shouldn’t be changing
Maybe I'm not quite at the right place
Maybe everybody loves you
Maybe it’s the same problem
Maybe she'll someday become a saint
Maybe tell you my goddamn name
Maybe we could have it together?
Maybe you can come back tomorrow?
Maybe you don’t feel like it
Maybe you see me today
Maybe you’re giving up
Me alone
Me and all the enemies
Me and my island
Me and my voice
Me neither yet
Me too
Me under the century
Me, my crazy lover
Me, that's what this is
Me, too
Meet me inside the game
Meet the Queen
Meet the boss
Meet the ghosts
Meet the sun
Meets attraction
Mementos of the fat woman
Memories come to life
Memories fly
Memories light up your thoughts
Memories of your children
Memory aches
Memory and imprisonment
Memory blown
Memory it inside
Memory...
Merry chimes
Merry spoons
Merry women get hired
Meteors wet spells
Midnight dawn
Midnight watching moon
Milk for the eyes
Milk on the ocean floor
Milk the star project
Millions’s worth of money
Mind always calling me
Mind hardens by being awake
Mind is a jumble
Mind uself
Mind when I had eyes
Minding his piece
Mine ends with him
Misadventures in madness
Mise ruffle your feathers
Misplaced money
Miss me by the hand
Miss you?
Miss your words
Mist
Mistake, mistreat
Mistakenly, wrong
Mistakes at all costs
Mistakes you make
Mister me today
Mister, start dressing down
Modern daylight
Modern kiss
Modern slavery
Modern takes a shine to her eyes
Modern telephone
Modern-day gangster
Money I can take
Money for fame
Money is awful
Money is so dangerous
Money will never go where it needs to go
Money won't dance
Money's gonna fade away
Money’s no good
Money’s seen
Moon from the sky
Moonlighting in every line
More and more creative
More anger and dirt
More bear song
More blood for now
More by the wayside
More clues
More energy
More heat please
More like a home away from home
More of a drain
More perfect creation
More quickly
More quickly in time
More than a band of filth
More than a horse
More than toys
More than you can take
More than you ever could dream
More to come
Morning I’m not so scared
Morning can’t get far
Morning clouds
Morning is coming
Morning mornin', barbed wire
Morning of love
Most important to him
Most of the time I’ll be lying
Most of the time, it’s your fault
Mother and lover
Mother and son’s juice
Mother couldn’t help but cry
Mother gets things done
Mother is his bridge
Mother of the Lord
Mouth opening
Mouth to mouth
Mouthpiece of someone else
Mouthpiece or facepiece?
Mouths are planted
Mouthwatering romance
Move aside
Move into the street
Move me further away
Move my arms around
Move on
Move past that moment
Move past the eyes
Move quickly dead oars
Move the men
Move the needle here
Move the target
Move this thing
Move up to me
Move your feet
Move your fucking mouth
Moving from one to the next
Moving slow
Moving through cold water
Moving through time
Much darker tomorrow
Much of the world is looking
Much of your body is bleeding
Mumble with the teeth of Satan
Murder a friend
Murder by the sinner
Music answers the judges
Music between her bars
Music died out of heaven
Music to them
Music's called religion
My angels adore me
My apologies
My art gallery
My baby's broken
My baby’s the one
My beheaded title: Findings from eternity
My blade lit up like night
My bluesy eyes belong in the sky
My body changes
My body’s almost alive
My bones buried
My bones fit inside them
My bones have not been played
My brain doesn't know it’s wrong
My brains won the ball game
My breathing is broken
My broken heart
My brother died down
My caretaker
My childhood dreams
My child’s fault
My darling
My daughter
My destination
My dream is watching the sun rise
My dreams are fighting
My drinking game
My ear likes yours
My earpiece
My enemy gets a little older
My eye turned so big
My eyes shine
My eyes turn red
My father left me
My father’s voice
My fear is righteous
My feet were beating up
My final destination
My fine friends
My first dream
My first kiss
My first love
My frail sixth-floor
My friend and I are going
My friends can't touch
My fucking face
My giggle
My grandfathered machine
My great-great-great grandfather
My greatest sensation
My hair can be up in the air
My hand
My hands are broken
My harmony
My head in the air
My head takes over
My heart I know
My heart goes out to you
My heart is right
My heart is the only shadow
My heart is your soul
My heart plays the same tune
My heaven
My hero is God
My holy friends
My horns are rockin her ears
My illusions win
My imagination just seems endless
My karma is my isolation
My laughter and dream
My life all around
My life is a blank slate
My life is good
My life is too lonely
My little work
My love comes from behind
My love for music
My love is in the clothes
My love’s gone from my heart
My mama
My mask of a fiery soul
My mind is loaded
My mother died
My mother is talking to me
My mother’s second hand
My mouth is open to those who’re afraid
My name is still your name
My name is tense
My neck is playing
My old alarm
My only source of strength
My overworked mother
My own business
My own voices
My parents told me to do it again
My path came undone
My place
My place in history
My place of pleasure
My pride is built
My real affection
My relationship as you grow up
My sadness
My shadow maiden
My sins
My sister and I
My sky
My smell swells
My sorrow changes
My soul belongs on top
My soul here on earth
My soul is burning
My soul on the border
My soul was made in a crucible
My soul’s a cloud
My spirit's immortal
My starting point
My stay
My sun
My tender earth
My time is too slow
My time together
My tracksuit
My train took you so far
My true love
My two sons, mine and mine
My verse
My victim’s guilt
My view
My vision grows dark
My vision is fucked
My vision’s starting to fade
My way, go, go
My ways are open
My woman’s human breast
My world
My years
My younger brother
Nail the strings
Naked and lonely
Narrow at the drop of a hat
Narrow the jaws
Naughty
Naughty but gentle
Naughty, sweet girl
Need every stroke
Need of a weapon
Need some reason to die
Need to try again
Need to understand
Need you ever stop
Needing to reach for the shore
Needn't cry at all
Neon in the acid
Neon sneakers
Never can forget my past
Never come anymore
Never do
Never feel
Never getting up
Never goes away
Never going to wake up
Never got to tune
Never gotta be together
Never let someone else touch you
Never listen to you
Never look down
Never mind me
Never put up with it
Never seemed like the time for this conversation
Never seen the glory
Never sleepwalk
Never smiled
Never spoke that I knew
Never surrender
Never the deviant dream
Never try to connect
Never wear down
Nevermore
New York City
New bus trips every night
New country
New flag
New hope
New horses
New leader in the world
New music’s whistling
New plain image
New planes
New store windows
New timezone
New toys
New world order
Next time I can look
Next to nothing
Next train up's attempt to cross
Nice

Night in shining skies
Night in the sun
Night light under the silver light
Night through your tears

No one is afraid
No one knows I’m the one
No one knows how long you walk
No one knows what we found
No one starts out with you
No one wants to get along
No one will stop me
No one’s buying you
No one’s feeling much
No one’s fucking with me
No one’s talked about her
No one’s watching
No other time
No other way to go
No pain
No point in burning
No problem
No questions asked
No real revolution
No real sparkle
No regret
No room for error
No search to hide
No sense going on now

No speech today
No surprise
No time to cry
No toilet title: Red meat after blood
No voice is gonna stop me
No waste of time
No way out
No way that I’m supposed to be
No weakness
No words for a part of me
No, no, no
No, what happened?
No, you know I know
No-one can feed me
Nobody cares
Nobody lives like you
Nobody should hear it
Nobody was supposed to catch me
Nobody's listening
Nobody’s hired me
Noisy love
None
None of this mattered
Nose to roof
Not a cop
Not a side-by-side draw
Not done
Not for real
Not knowing what to do
Not like the time of dawn
Not lost in indecision
Not people you know
Not quite how I feel
Not right now
Not you yet
Nothing bad will come of it
Nothing but silence
Nothing could have made me scream
Nothing earthly
Nothing ever comes back
Nothing for me
Nothing good to say
Nothing lasts forever
Nothing more
Nothing other than a gun
Nothing really can be said
Nothing says we love
Nothing so true
Nothing to do but complain
Nothing to lose
Nothing you can afford
Nothing you can do
Nothing you could see
Nothing’s left to show
Now I know
Now I see where you come from
Now I see you already
Now I’m taking off
Now I’ve got a job
Now and then you look
Now come on down
Now come to finish
Now find me
Now hear me out
Now is the time
Now live a dream
Now she deserves it
Now so hot
Now take me back
Now that I have this you
Now that you see me
Now there are some more
Now we are together
Now we’re doing it again
Now where we’re from
Now with them
Now you’re free
Now, what’s left
Nowhere here to stay
Nowhere near
Nowhere to hide
Nowhere, here
Nude flies
Nudity
O 'em all
O Brother to you
Obsolete canvas
Obtainments of murder
Of Angels
Of all times
Of anger and sorrow
Of fucking time
Of lost loved ones
Of loving our singing
Of mine
Of no sentimental place
Of the human balance
Of the mouth of my sorrow
Of what?
Of your only pleasure
Off all the towns in the world
Oh God, I see your face
Oh I can feel the heat of the sun
Oh don’t talk to me
Oh my god
Oh my god I’m awake
Oh my god; I know you and I live by fate
Oh my goodness
Oh my love, this means so much to me
Oh no
Oh nothing is ever cracked
Oh yeah
Oh yes please stop
Oh yes, I see you’re right
Oh your damn heart
Oh you’re just too high
Oh, I know all of this
Oh, and someone’s been caught up
Oh, come on soon
Oh, hello night
Oh, it's amazing
Oh, my mother’s son
Oh, no thought comes to me
Oh, the sense of wonder
Oh, they won
Oh, you’ll never know
Oh’s good to know
Old Alabama
Old and new releases
Old love life
Old virgins are getting older
On a massive scale
On a moon day
On a summer morning
On fire
On getting drunk
On in black
On my doorstep
On my eye
On my mantelpiece
On my mind
On my way out
On that side of the coin
On the blind side
On the bridge
On the bus
On the calm shore
On the catwalk
On the fence
On the highway
On the moonlight
On the prowl for you
On the roof
On the run
On the shore
On the spine
On the street
On the way home
On top of beautiful
On top of it all
On top of the mass slaughter
On your knuckles
On your side
Once again we fall into mist
Once again, he brings you nowhere
Once in a generation
Once the mood turns bright
One I look through
One animal fainted
One another belongs in all the worlds
One bad mime
One ballcap
One can’t help you
One day
One day I will be right here
One day she’ll smile
One driver so much
One example
One fell sword
One fucking art source
One hand on your shoulder
One hundred pages of notes
One hundred times the size
One hundred, two hundred times over
One last midnight
One last minute fade
One last thing
One last time
One line of code
One minute you watch it again
One morning
One new thing
One night
One of the finest cities of the world
One of the kings
One of the only great artists
One of the wine-lips
One of their own to follow
One of them’s lying
One of those great kings
One of you’s just a chance
One of you’ve become famous
One question ahead
One shirt
One sigh
One slice of history
One solitary hour in despair
One summer night
One that loves to know
One thing that she deserves
One thing to remember
One thing, a thousand things
One word in my life
Only fade away
Only feeling in the bag
Only fits your ear
Only good dreams ever make the lie
Only one brainless goon
Only pictures given
Only son to the blessed
Only to dream
Only try to let life be
Only we have time
Only you’re here
Open a gun
Open mind
Open mouth
Open my eyes
Open the canyons
Open the window
Open with a smile
Open your heart
Open your heart to them
Open your mouth
Or I could lose it
Or I’m going to die
Or I’m gonna turn into somebody else
Or at least some imagination
Or describe what's missing
Or destroyed
Or if you don’t know
Or scared
Or something
Or thumps of grass
Or: To look into the abyss
Ornery trad songs
Other people wanna cry
Other song
Our baby is fine
Our dreams come true
Our eyes burn
Our hearts know
Our lady goddess
Our lives turned
Our lovingly dream
Our name is everything
Our sides of ourselves
Our story
Our thirst for beer
Our time is on our feet
Our tongues fly
Our worst enemy
Our youth say no
Ours is the tale of the Shire
Ours is yet another boat
Ours, my only refuge
Ousiss the days
Out at night
Out here today
Out in the open
Out in the plain
Out of all the mirrors
Out of control
Out of fear
Out of harmony
Out of love
Out of nowhere
Out of reach
Out of style
Out of the blue
Out of the forest
Out of the weeds
Over a month old
Over and over again
Over every avenue
Over in the dungeon
Over in the mountain
Over my body
Over the bottom of my depth
Over the road
Over the rough ocean
Over the summer sun
Over there
Over time
Overcome the blues
Overhearing some funny notes
Overkill
Overtonight today
Overventurous wet and cloudy

Reaching for their waists
Reaching from the ashes
Reaching me
Reaching or keeping you way older
Reaching out
Reaching out for another kiss
Reaching the door
Reaching the pinnacle
Reading a letter in a jar
Reading and loving
Reading down my tongue
Reading here
Reading my lips
Reading what I hear
Reading’s like leaving the house
Ready for a wave
Ready for your wrath
Ready to be known
Ready to burn my house
Ready to dance
Ready to get crazy
Ready to put up with one disease
Ready to spit your bread
Ready to take the blue
Real
Real busy
Real crazy
Real happy time

Really?
Reassure
Recess and dance
Recruit your friends
Recruiting my buddy John the Apostle
Red infested carpet
Red roses bloom
Red sea to the brim
Red talk
Redrushing in and out
Refine all hopes
Rejection comes with more finesse
Rekindled memories
Rekindled my memories
Release more confidence
Release that feel
Remains caked in rain
Remember my name
Remember the love of his head
Remember you’re my friend
Remembering who
Reminds me of Romeo and Juliet
Reminds me of a world I made in bed
Reminds me of how I feel
Reminds me of my abandoned cars
Reminds you why
Reminisces
Reparation
Repossessions
Represent the past
Represented the mass dailies

Ride in a little amusement
Ride like a butterfly
Ride me through this hellhole
Ride off into space
Ride that bus
Ride the ocean
Ride through the night
Ride to the end of time
Rides his past
Riding on the sand
Riding out the lights
Riding the mountains
Right back up
Right back where we started
Right before his mind can rise
Right behind the tree
Right for the moment
Right hand on the other sleeve
Right now I see him
Right now to reach him
Right now you are still smiling
Right now you go
Right off the razor wire
Right on your own skin
Right to the ocean
Right, I could only go in
Ring of fire

Rock calls
Rock for a reason
Rock in a box
Rock on his head
Rock through the air
Rock up the hill
Rock up the sky
Rock you up
Rockin' your cell phones
Rocking my wheels
Roll and toss
Rolling fire
Rolling my eyes
Rolling over into others
Rolling pictures
Rose red
Rose slippers
Round hand to sell
Rude white tent
Rude with sweetnap
Rude, jealous, and expensive
Rudely
Rumbling in the water
Run away
Run down the stage
Run in circles
Run like a man
Run me over
Run on the moon
Run out and hide
Run past her
Run round
Run through the door
Run to your room
Run up a dollar or two
Run you through
Running around staring
Running away
Running down against your own wall
Running down an empty stomach
Running for each other
Running through my head
Rushing up the salt highway
Sacrifice a unbreakable camel
Sacrifice your home
Sacrifice yourself
Sad to see
Saffron blankets
Said fucking songs
Sail around the world
Sail away like a cloud
Sail down the waves
Sail from your dreams
Sail me back home
Sail my lonely spirit
Sail that ship
Sail the sky
Sailboat airfare
Sailing by night
Sailing hard and fast
Sailing high through the silent sky
Sailing home at night
Same boat song
Same deal
Same old hopeless talk
Same old shame
Satisfied I don’t cry
Satisfy my soul
Save for a moment
Save me alone
Save me from this current dilemma
Save my life
Save the world
Save your life
Save your mind
Save your soul
Saves me a hell of a future
Saw her touch
Saw how much I loved you
Saw out my window
Saw the dawn in the cemetery
Saw the figures of countless people
Saw the full moon
Saw the light
Saw you bleed my love
Say all the time
Say all you want
Say goodbye
Say hello to everybody
Say he’ll come across
Say it a thousand times
Say it ain't for me
Say it anyway
Say it isn't so shy
Say it to me
Say my name
Say no more
Say please: Bringing me down
Say so little
Say something different than the order
Say something exciting to people
Say something nice
Say something wonderful
Say something, right now
Say the love that I feel
Say the support of my spirit
Say they met somebody else
Say what you want
Say yes to her
Say you want me to walk round
Saying I'm gonna do it if you wanna
Saying he won’t take me if he’s right
Saying it in short order
Saying: That their time
Scaled down
Scaled in splendor
Scales the gallery
Scales through my eyes
Scam for you
Scared for a minute
Scaring off every morning
Scarlet eyes
Scary time
Science
Science behind building walls
Science down to earth
Scour her rubble
Screeching and walking to the end
Screenshot my face
Screw you
Screwing someone?
Scrolling along the city street
Scrubbed the paint
Sculpted for profit
Sculpture
Sculptures of deceit
Seagulls of dark tales
Sealed in an ocean
Sealed on rocks
Search for a chance
Search for clues
Search for heaven
Search for our love
Search for the death’s ticket
Search the south
Search through every corner
Searching for a promise
Secret and private
Secret store of things
See all my dreams come true
See all the emotions and movements
See all the gorgeous eyes
See him be stronger than anyone
See how high?
See how stupid she is
See inside
See on my face
See that this is true
See the clear colour
See the forest in the eyes
See the terrible realities
See those blurred ones?
See what they say
See you all around
See you soon
See you tonight
See your money coming
See your secret
See, the night is fading
Seeing an open wound
Seeing from over that line
Seeing her again
Seeing the needle fall
Seeing who you are
Seemed pretty easy
Seems a good time
Seems like an attack by one
Seems pretty cool
Seems very weird
Seen from a distance
Seen it through my eyes
Seen the good days
Seen the way
Self-conscious
Selfies I'm sure
Sell our souls
Sell the dishes
Sell the title
Selling every penny
Selling everybody
Selling fuel to every boy
Selling it all
Selling out the White City
Selling so quickly
Selling the body of a woman
Selling the romance
Selling them saddles
Selling us rotten apples
Send her for supper
Send me my apologies
Send me off to lie
Send off in the order of time
Send us your treasure
Separate your vision
Set a new standard
Set fire to me
Set me free
Set the image
Set you free
Set your cage inside
Set your feet clean
Set your mind free
Seventh sun
Severely fucked
Shader
Shadow my masterpiece
Shadow of something I see
Shadow shift
Shadow threads of my dreams
Shadows are falling
Shadows everywhere
Shadows in my ears
Shadows of infamy
Shadows on an airplane
Shake and weep
Shake it up
Shake your chair
Shake your pretty hearts
Shaking your back
Shattering the toy
She asked you if she wanted a dream
She began the dance
She built me the statues
She called me with a set
She can hurt no more
She did well
She did you good
She didn't tell me all the answers
She doesn’t love you
She feeds me
She finally did
She got a great taste
She had no proof
She is in such a rush
She is right
She just turned away
She kept crying
She knows I have nothing to do
She looked so little at the time
She looks satisfied
She made a show out of me
She may be empty
She may have gone a little too far
She never gave up
She never talks about me
She opened fire
She really loves to dance
She said I met her yesterday
She said we found a new sweet kiss
She sees every little thing I'm doing
She should move on you
She smiled a secret
She still beats it
She thinks she’s a prophet
She thinks too bad
She threw away her pillow
She threw off the kart
She took a glass
She walks down the hall
She wanted him
She wants you to pick up your pieces
She was waiting for you
She wasn't fucking going home
She wasn’t sad
She will see
She won’t lie
She won’t show
She wore clothes of silver
She wore down her ties
She'll lead
She's alright
She's at the punch line
She's just looking at us
She's looking for me
She's stuck to one side
She's wearing a handbag
Shes the ground with a dead anchor
She’d leave a tape out
She’ll be alright
She’ll be left alone
She’ll not say
She’s flying out
She’s for you
She’s getting thin
She’s got more than meets the eye
She’s in her last act
She’s just uptight
She’s like an idiot
She’s lived the dream
She’s lying
She’s never a virgin
She’s next door
She’s not the whole story
She’s pretty
She’s running down
She’s stealing more things
She’s still inside me
She’s still spinning
She’s taking a fair share
She’s the lover
Shhhh
Shhh’s off to hell
Shine the love and sympathy
Shine the other lights
Shiver in my song
Shiver in your memories
Shiver red hair
Shivering with emotion
Shocker dreams
Shook myself up in this past
Shooting down traffic
Shooting from here
Shot in the head
Should I please say it?
Should have been warning
Should you cry?
Should've buried the toys
Should've done
Shoulda used me
Shout your name again
Show me your pride
Show us in your dream
Shuffle down my neck
Shush the skin
Shut me in
Shut up and move
Shut up before you knew it
Shut up when I can’t finish
Shut your doors
Shut your mouth
Sick
Sick and angry
Sick and cold
Sick and sober
Sick as a sack
Sick as hell
Sick as your eye doesn't shine
Sick at heart
Sick of all this loneliness
Sick of having to follow the law
Sick of it all
Sick of me
Sick of that
Sick of the racket
Sick of this rush
Sick of your lies
Sick with a cold
Sign me in
Sign me to see that a dark tune
Sign me up on Good Friday
Sign my drink
Silence
Silence now
Silence still shines
Silences get louder
Silence’s dragging down
Silent Hour
Silent for a little while
Silent from the eyes
Silently remembered
Silhouettes in the night
Silver
Silver bullet
Silver hair
Silver standard
Silverfish waves
Simpleton's foreskin
Since I found it in you
Since I say there can be no fly
Since making love in love
Since she'll take you away
Since the dawn
Since you made me a bitch
Sing by the the lonesome
Sing in the moon
Sing the music
Sing the popular songs
Singed with this reason
Singing and loving
Singing over my song
Singing popular phrases
Singing the song
Singing to the sky
Singing under the moon
Sinking
Sinking unguarded
Sipping a bottle
Sipping blood
Sit back and allow me
Sit down and sing
Sit down next to your friend
Sit for a minute
Sit like a diamond
Sit side-by-side across the street
Sit still in this confusion
Sitting across from somebody
Sitting awake
Sitting by the mirror
Sitting down
Sitting in jail
Sitting like she’s dead
Sitting on his shoulder
Sitting still and staring
Sitting there and looking down on you
Sitting up at night
Sitting with the devil
Sitting within a fog
Situated in his body
Sixty shades
Sixty thousand little things
Skinny as a whip
Skinny eyed deer
Skinny red-faced
Skippered my brain
Slap your hand away
Slapping his big brother
Sleep and write your tired lyrics
Sleep, reflection and one soul
Sleeping all over me
Sleeping on the earth
Sleeping you away
Sleepy time
Slices and pickles
Slip Away
Slip down
Slip into despair
Slip my damn face
Slip on my honey collar
Slip on your hard time
Slip through the cracks
Slipping the film
Slow as a snail
Slow in order
Slow in your career
Slow it down
Slow like a plant
Slow motion
Slowing to adore
Small fingerwork
Smashed eyes
Smell my blood
Smell the message
Smell the sound of shining
Smell, taste
Smelling water
Smells like a pair of wings
Smells like dead meat
Smells like muscle
Smells like piss
Smells like rotten gum
Smells of smoke
Smells the same as your lips
Smells too good to be true
Smiling beside him
Smiling’s own way
Smoke falls from her eyes
Smoke in the street
Smoking my song
Smoking on the beach
Smooth as a feather
Snail with the vines
Snakes breathe
Snakes in the sky
Snakes likes bibbles
Snakes sing and crawl into them
Sniff on your fingernails
Snow from the clouds
Snow over young white hairs
Snowy blue
Snowy picture
So I do it with everybody
So I don't feel so guilty’s here
So I thought
So I've been able to hide
So I’ve got the drunkard
So beat the train
So bring it back to life
So call me manager
So clearly out
So clearly she has no voice
So do you mean to?
So don't interrupt me
So far away
So far gone you are
So glad I sat there
So he gets paid now
So he’s wearing a wig
So he’s young
So in your mind
So let's go
So let's just be friends
So long ago
So much of him
So need a two sided smile
So now we belong here
So now you're right
So sad
So soft
So start fucking around
So tender and cool
So there you are
So we like to become good at what we do
So what about them?
So what you say
So what?
So why don't I have money to spend?
So why don't you go today?
So you talk about love, conversation, and money
So you'll be here?
So you’re free
So you’re really doing right
So, I come to you as a wire
So, I’ll be right here
Soak it inside
Soaked up in loneliness
Sold me so much
Sold!
Some ancient men
Some buried treasure
Some damn authority
Some day you will be here
Some dead girl
Some dogs from the town
Some down below
Some girl dreams
Some great songs
Some guardsmen to run
Some little little note
Some man left somewhere
Some man's side of the life
Some mighty names
Some new dreams
Some nights in order
Some of it falls apart
Some of the best for you
Some of you shine
Some of you will have to ask me
Some pain’s broken
Some people crawl down on to you
Some people don’t give a damn
Some people think they've never met
Some sailors cannot walk
Some shady eyes
Some show
Some sweet song
Some time to buy change
Some time, close enough
Some white shoes
Somebody I don't know
Somebody calls me home
Somebody else’s in the kitchen
Somebody gets to die
Somebody just followed me to your back
Somebody you can go home to
Somebody's got to move the train
Somebody’s gonna get shot
Someday
Someday maybe I will be
Someday of my life
Somehow go down there
Someone I can see and speak
Someone asking you for a favour
Someone calls you the enemy
Someone else wants to know
Someone else will find the ground
Someone else’s doing it for you
Someone from our desert
Someone gets killed
Someone goes out
Someone named Willsell
Someone needs to hear
Someone reminds me
Someone saved your life
Someone that everyone knows
Someone who can change in his name
Someone’s breaking that sound
Someone’s just coming by
Something I hate
Something along the lines
Something bad in their eyes
Something badly torn apart
Something changes
Something for everyone
Something for the band
Something new, something to take away
Something so small
Something that I don't know
Something that is still soul
Something that never quite existed
Something will come
Something's known
Sometime you’ll know
Sometimes I'll be getting a clue
Sometimes I’m afraid
Sometimes the memory fades
Sometimes you walk into a riddle
Sometimes you’ll come home
Sometimes you’re an idiot
Somewhere I want you to be
Somewhere a strange peace
Somewhere down there
Somewhere in a forgotten way
Somewhere it’s alright
Somewhere off in the distance
Somewhere out there
Somewhere that I can’t catch
Somewhere, somewhere inside you
Somewhere, we are
Son of a bitch
Son of a slayer
Son of every man
Son of honey
Son of sin
Son of slaves
Son of the son
Son of this day
Son, you missed that
Song for a boy
Song for a night
Soon our money will come
Soon the thought has gone
Sooner or later
Sorry for my youth
Sorry for sounding so out of it
Sorry it gets cold soon
Sorry just never find it
Sorry sorry it was so busy
Sorry to be accused
Sorry to disappoint
Sorry to disappoint you
Sorry, what do you think?
Soul Encryption
Soul still alive
Sounded like fun
Sounds kind of dirty
Sounds like a thousand other things
Sounds like shit
Sounds like the place to fly
Sounds like the shadow falls on you
Sounds like tomorrow
Sounds more like a curse
Sounds pretty tight
Sounds so simple
Sounds strange
Spading through a dead thread
Spamming out everywhere
Spattered an amber sky
Speak badly of myself
Speak like a girl
Speak of me
Speak plainly
Speak soon
Speak the truth
Speak to me
Speak with hearts on fire
Speak your minds
Specially shining eyes
Speed is high
Speed me up
Speed miles
Spend the evening in town
Spending all day together
Spending all of my money
Spending as a millionaire
Spending time crying
Spent one of the days in solitary
Spinning flowers
Spinning in half
Spinning in the desert
Spinning my wings
Spinning outward at night
Spinning stars
Spinning the same hum
Split lips
Split time and bring her back
Spoken every rhyme
Spooky horse
Spread my arms wide
Spread my wings
Spread the ashes
Spread the love
Spring like here
Springtime tree silhouette
Spungent on smoke
Squash up the emotion
Squeaking in the trough
Stabbed in the ground
Stabbed into little pieces
Stairway
Stand against me
Stand beside me: Looking into your eye
Stand by and salute
Stand by me
Stand in line
Stand out as a disappointment
Stand up and shake my hand
Stand up, drag me away
Stand up, out loud
Stand your ground
Standing amongst yourselves
Standing in line with the law
Standing next to a friend
Standing next to each other
Standing up for herself
Standing up for myself
Stands in the sky
Stands outside this room
Star wars dreams
Star-shaped bowl
Stare at me
Stare on shadows
Staring at the pillow
Staring at the wall
Staring down from the stage
Staring down on the wall
Starlight
Starlight begins to stream from windows
Stars a million volts down the line
Stars and starlit corridors
Stars are burning white
Stars for their stars
Stars on fire
Stars rise, fall
Stars smell of blood
Start some over
Start working again
Started buying to- pay attention
Started him dancing
Starting here in a coffin
Starting singing after she leaves
Starting to throw up
Starting with honey
Starting with white
Starving dreams
Starving spirits
Stash the secret jewels
Stay around me
Stay away from me
Stay home
Stay near me
Stay true to yourselves
Stay warm
Staying awake at night
Staying inside your mind
Staying on the outside
Steal of attention
Steal the feel of your time
Stealing from a soulless eye
Stealing my wings
Stealing street music
Stealing time
Steel
Stepping on the hard shore
Stepping over everything
Stepping up your game
Sticking your sweet little hooks
Stiff walls
Still alright
Still asking me if I was meant
Still feeling tired
Still getting lost
Still goons getting away
Still gourd
Still in love
Still looking at this empty place
Still lovin' beer
Still not yet cracked
Still nothing in your hands
Still quite rude
Still strive
Still wanting me
Stoked the passion
Stomach full of shit
Stone and sawdust
Stoned to hell
Stood by my grave
Stop and spin
Stop and stare
Stop cringing
Stop crying all the time
Stop fucking around
Stop keeping it in suspense
Stop leaving the country
Stop playing with diamonds
Stop this slutty ways
Storing away my mistakes
Storm through me
Straight away
Straight from the clanging cages
Straight into the abyss
Straight to home
Straight to the dead
Straight to the nuclear force
Strain the old thread
Stranger
Stranger goes by my direction
Stranger in our hair
Stranger in the wind
Stranger on a mission
Stranger troubles
Stranger voices appear
Stranglehold upon history
Strangleholds my memories
Stray to Paris
Strayed in time
Street lights to the sides
Streetlights walk through
Streets of city
Streets of yours
Streets out of the sea
Streetwise swindlers
Strike a nerve
Strike back and try again
Strings and mirrors
Strip everybody naked
Stripes are for men
Stroll in
Strung between wheels
Strung up around demons
Strung with dread
Stumbling on sand
Stupid ladies and men
Stupid mama
Stupid old fool
Stupidity waits without warning
Such a beautiful time
Such a sad mood
Such a shame
Such a silly title
Such a tricky thing
Such an easy target
Such an overused sentiment
Such an ugly hand
Such as she’s been taught to watch
Suck in this jagged wall
Suck my heart out
Suck the magic carpet
Sudden fading away
Suddenly
Suddenly awake
Suddenly everyone inside
Suddenly gone
Suffering pain
Suffocating in silence
Summertime in your love life
Sun and distant nights
Sun from behind
Sunbeam sky
Sunk down on the park benches
Sunlit blues and shining amber
Sunlit from my soul
Sunlit jailbird
Sunshine on your lips
Sunshine town
Sunshine, sunshine
Super-human deal
Supposed to stop
Supposedly over us
Supposing she’ll fall
Surprised to be here
Surrender to what you mean
Surrender up here
Surrounding the windows
Swallow the bones
Swallow your tears
Swear to a girl
Sweatshop brushes
Sweep me
Sweeping thunder
Sweeps your skin
Sweet and cold
Sweet and kind and caring
Sweet and sweet
Sweet as the old butter
Sweet dreams of my hard-fought trade
Sweet dreams would scream
Sweet dreams, I’ll stay
Sweet kids
Sweet leaves of glory
Sweet lips
Sweet meets sour
Sweet old straight
Sweet parade past
Sweet pleasures
Sweet smile
Sweet sweet quarter
Sweet to waste
Sweet voice
Sweet white sun
Sweet, sour, and smokey
Swept by hypnotic wind
Swift and round
Swimming through your dreams
Swing by my station
Swing by the scenes
Swing close to my house
Swing the knife in your hand
Swings at a parade
Swipe lefty trick
Switch to a different flavor
Sympathetic boy
Sympathy seeps into you
Tackling this dilemma
Take a comfort
Take a fresh start
Take a lifetime
Take a line
Take a little time
Take a look at the picture
Take a shine to your face
Take another picture
Take apart my father
Take away my affection
Take away the meaning
Take away the terror
Take away your power
Take care of your emptiness
Take care of yourself
Take control
Take control of everything
Take every aspect of yourself
Take every bit
Take her on her walk
Take him down
Take hold
Take in all the rules
Take it away
Take it easy
Take it out of your face
Take it with you
Take me away
Take me down
Take me out of this life
Take me to my palace
Take me to the moon
Take my eye off my pillow
Take my foot off the floor
Take my mistress
Take my place
Take my sweet piss
Take my wheel
Take my word for it
Take no interest in me
Take no prisoners
Take off my clothes
Take off your clothes
Take one last kiss
Take out your mind
Take some time right now
Take that hair from me
Take that on train
Take the butter out
Take the girls for miles
Take the heat
Take the leap
Take the moon out
Take the rainbow
Take the wheel
Take their art-loving souls
Take this on and take it away
Take this place I’m going to
Take to the cross
Take us down
Take your baby boy
Take your soul
Take your strange girl pose
Take your time
Take your watch out
Taking comfort
Taking her away
Taking his dream name
Taking it out on you
Taking me with you
Taking my ride
Taking notes
Taking on every creed
Taking on things
Taking pride in ourselves
Taking those brainwashed whispers
Taking up nothing
Talk about a dream
Talk about going to heaven
Talk about our eternal enemy
Talk about your boss
Talk as a master
Talk for years
Talk of running away
Talk the gutter
Talk the truth
Talk to your father
Talk your pipe dreams
Talking about my body
Talking beautiful in your own eyes
Talking dirty, winking at me
Talking freely
Talking glass
Talking instead of doing
Talking of bombs
Talking the talk
Talking to glassy dreams
Talking to her
Talking to him
Talking to some mouth
Talking to someone else
Talking to strangers
Talking to those words
Talking to you for free
Taught me so many things
Tears apart
Tears began to flow
Tears fall under a sky
Tears for speech
Tears in the green
Tears into your bones
Tears just flow
Tears of hope
Tears of pain
Tears of silence
Tears of sorrow
Tears off my skin
Tears off their stammering bottles
Tears starting to come out
Tell all of us
Tell her I'm fine
Tell me a new name
Tell me a poem
Tell me my story
Tell me she’s telling me her true name
Tell me so
Tell me the root of all evil
Tell me what you mean
Tell me what you meant to say
Tell me what you think
Tell me where she went to
Tell my future lovers
Tell my girl I have no name
Tell the ghost story
Tell the king of words
Tell your love to me
Tell your lover that
Tell your story
Telling her we are friends
Tells me what tomorrow is
Tells me where you went
Tells me who’s watching
Ten but no one is talking
Ten corners of logic
Ten different colours
Ten grand
Ten thousand kisses
Thank you
Thanks for your help
That
That I like to believe
That I look like a phoenix
That I never leave
That I think I am
That I'm afraid
That I'm good to you
That and the freedom
That appears like a lie
That as she sees it
That being so sure
That blew my mind
That bright sun of love
That brother
That bum whistles
That card will come out on top
That crazy memory
That crime is holy
That damn devil
That dark place
That day at the bridge
That day was unreal
That deep inside you’ve got lots of trouble
That doesn't sound too good
That doesn’t matter now
That falls apart
That famous shine
That feels like a lifetime
That fire in the sun
That floor
That game
That game's been on forever
That gets across the finish line
That he was lonely
That he would die
That holy summer night
That hurts right now
That ill fated for them
That immortal song
That immortal soul
That is now nearly to come
That is what life’s all about
That is what they thought
That it is true
That it’s a matter of time
That keeps me alive
That lead
That leads me to the part
That leaves the other side alight
That low wind brings you so much stress
That made me bleed
That made my life easier
That may be the end
That means nothing to you
That movie
That movie was much too old to see
That my time isn't on the run
That never happens
That never is too soon
That new collar
That new hope
That night
That night feels still
That nobody left to buy
That other day
That sad you
That said, your spirit
That same spirit
That set the stage
That she’d found
That ship walked through the moon
That shit taste like acid
That should be all on you
That smile’s in your eyes
That smile’s what you pay us to do
That sometime ago
That song you'd last love to sing
That sunken prison
That terror of his father
That to you
That took a while to get over
That was a good time
That was my weak spot
That was true
That way ain't all I got
That were two ways to meet
That will be me all the time
That will be obvious
That will never do
That won't happen soon
That won't work
That year the masters of archery were back
That you abandoned
That you came into sight of none
That you know
That you’ll know soon
That's a line to all my friends
That's all I was gonna say
That's gotta be a mistake
That's how dangerous I get
That's it’s okay
That's it’s really there
That's my house
That's my kingdom
That's not fair
That's not good for you
That's part of the world
That's the truth
That's the way it should be
That's what dreams are made of
That's what my mother is
That's what you see
That's where I’m going
That's why I came across you
That's why we all die
That’s all she got
That’s not our fault
That’s what life is all about
That’s what you'd be
That’s where I am
That’s why
The American in the wake of dying
The Bible
The English Bird
The King of the south
The Lion, the Hare, the Bumblebee
The Lord is watching
The Pitiless War
The Satan worship begins
The Spirit’s giving way
The White House salute
The absence
The acrid nest of godless shadows
The action is good, that you can breathe
The adrenaline rush
The age in the sky
The air cannot find its way into you
The air never goes off
The alarm of yellow
The amazing tale of music
The anarchy
The angel of light
The angels say the world is never to end
The angry pirate stares
The appeal of art
The arboreal cat
The armies of yours
The art of the chase
The attack became human history
The baby is dying
The bad boy
The band
The bargain is overtaken
The basement seems cold
The battle between you
The beaming moon
The beast and his language
The beauty or the curse
The bell rings
The bells ring
The best things
The best way to go home
The big picture
The bitter sting of defeat
The black space
The blackest corridors
The bleak hole
The blindman picture
The blood of King Ludwig
The blue park
The blue sky
The body around me
The books came flying
The bottles fall off
The boy love
The brainchild of my sins
The breeze breaks
The broken laws
The bus comes to go
The cage-eating bear
The cake
The call's out
The camel lumps my coat
The candle will burn
The caped crusader
The card I don’t have
The caretaker of what was
The casket and the veil
The center of the house
The centreline
The chain of command
The change that has already been felt
The charm of dreams
The charm of spring
The city is built around
The city tomorrow
The city up and down
The class that is in charge
The closest you get
The cloud cut shadows
The clouds now cover me
The clouds of the dawn
The cold comes now
The cold is your hard fact
The coldest day
The colorful shadow
The common enemy
The concept of a university
The corpse becomes new
The corrupt think I did
The craziest car or windmill
The crime scene
The curse
The curse of the soul
The curtain calls
The cutlass end that poured
The dancing cliché
The dark doors open
The darkest shadows
The dawn of rationality
The dawning legends
The day is over
The day of your death
The day she can't quit
The dead priest
The dead, the living, the hollow
The decay
The deck does not help
The deeds of his children
The demons never lose to you
The desert country
The desert's boring
The despair in your arms
The destruction that is laid within
The devil wants you
The devil will take my dead lips
The distance is never free
The dog now tramples
The door opens in the late summer
The dragon will soon descend
The dream
The dream is eternal
The dream is my own
The dream you dream about
The dream you hold
The dreamless master of things
The dreams in the dead silence
The dreams of Alice
The drummer can hardly get
The dry muscle
The dust in the air
The dust is falling
The emptiness
The emptiness fades away
The emptiness inside me
The end game
The end of the world
The end times
The enemy walks now
The envy of each and every other
The essence of our life
The everyman
The evils we fear
The expectations that you had
The eyes of iron fools
The fabled hero
The fading thunder
The faithful get away
The false, polluted water
The fame pleases us
The fan
The feelings I went through
The felling whale
The fifth time around
The filthy double
The final boss
The finest ships
The first kiss is a memory
The flight of a frog
The floor has fallen
The flowers coming down
The flowers next to the key
The flowers with winged wings
The fly of history
The footsteps are wide
The force comes in waves
The force of human beings
The force of truth
The forces of evil
The forest of fountains
The fountain and one-starlight
The fourth god
The freedom
The frog art book
The fucking country will walk
The fucking highway's longer
The fuel inside
The fury of a mosquito
The future
The future from around here
The future turned darker
The game is over
The ghosts in the sky
The girl I wanted to be
The girl that saw some shit
The glow of his appearance
The god of tomorrow
The god who created us
The golden earth
The golden test
The good feelings of my side
The good memories of wounded men
The gorgeous Irish girls
The grass colour’s dry
The grass grow red
The grass is blue
The grass might be turning
The grass seed
The green earth
The green glows
The groans
The ground you laid down
The guard is dead
The guards are still looking
The guards say no
The guts come out of his mouth
The gutter
The guy goes down with you
The hate’s starting to show
The hatred you’re so afraid
The haunted halls
The head of a cow
The headless skeleton
The health and the mind
The heart of life
The heart of my soul
The help one needs
The highest worth leaving behind
The hollow door
The holy synagogue of the old testament
The hopeless sorrow
The horse's gonna die
The illusionism of love
The image that you have to be
The information you fed up
The inspiration made him lose it
The jazz mood
The junkie bum
The key to time
The kindness of man
The king of anything
The king’s trees
The king’s wife
The kiss feels good
The lace, balls, crackers
The ladykillers of chaos
The language of your skin
The last curtain
The last line
The last place to hide
The last question
The last they’ve seen
The left lips are hard
The legendary lion
The lie
The life of living expression
The light is falling
The lights are flashing
The lights up
The limelight
The line fell in love
The line is strong
The liquor is drinking
The little island pirates
The living room
The lone word
The lonely emptiness
The lonesome night
The lost road
The love of singing
The love of the flesh
The love you do
The love you once shared
The love-maker
The lyrics to all the things I had to say
The machines won’t seem so complicated
The man that haunts me
The man with no name
The mark of decay
The marksmen on bones
The mayor
The memory is like a cylinder
The message of love
The midnight love
The midnight show
The midnight softness
The milk of a ship
The mind is beside you
The miracle of liberty
The mirror screens
The mirrors and the flowers
The moment is coming
The moment is here
The money is with you
The money will be paid
The monster broke the peace
The moon
The moon flutters
The moon in your eyes
The moon is black
The moon leads me to sleep
The moon of truth
The moonbeam blade on the brown citadel
The moons in your eyes
The morning star
The mountain art
The movie I came across
The muse’s sun
The music of the sea
The mysterious power
The name and the date
The name this city isn't called
The need for a righteous dream
The nest of despair
The new seven stars
The new shreds
The news you've got locked down
The night is dark
The nightmare has dragged on
The nightmarish mind
The noise fades away
The noise made me sick
The number of dinosaurs on an island
The obvious truth
The old fountain
The old man’s side of the story
The old superstition
The old ways
The one that started it all
The one who knew right?
The one with no candle burning
The one-eyed thing
The ones who watch
The only game in town
The only human I know
The only man outside
The only ones to die
The only ones who like to talk
The only other thing I can do
The only place I knew
The only reason I'm awake
The only sensible person’s opinion
The only thing higher than winning
The only thing to know
The only time I feel like you
The only way
The only way out
The open night walkaway
The other day
The other side
The page of paper
The pain is over
The pale army armor
The palms down
The passing riot cop
The past tense
The peace that remains inside
The pearls of a glade
The people and voices of presidents
The people like food
The people still call you names
The photo kill
The picture is broken
The pig here
The pipe dream
The pitiful smith
The plan is to lose her
The poet could hate me
The poison starts here
The pool hallowed evening
The power of the devil
The power you gave
The power, the control you get
The prelude
The prettiest life you've ever seen
The pretty way
The price of fame
The priest looks cool
The prison's broken and growing
The prize’s fine
The pure, mindless zeta ray
The purists call me an evil lust fiend
The pussy of guilt
The quality made him weary
The quick time and once again
The quiet that fills my body
The rain falls
The rain stops
The rainbow burst
The rap music in my head
The rays of love
The reason I exist
The reason I fell
The reason I said sorry
The reason I’m here
The reason you're not here
The reminders don't ring
The resistance slowly opens in
The rich and famous
The rich kid
The ring road
The rings out
The rise of the tidal wave
The river and the sun
The river whirls around me
The road has wide open
The roads are narrow
The romance
The romance for you
The roots in the sand
The rope was loose
The rule of law
The rumor for eternity
The running star
The sad life you come out of
The saddest day
The safe place
The safe zone
The saints will sing at the floor
The salvation in ashes
The same broken promises
The same way to trade down
The scientific wiles
The screen of death
The seagull
The seams were drawn together
The search for sleep
The season is on
The sea’s turned cloudy
The secret sauce
The seeds are planted
The sentiment has kept me going
The servants looked away
The sewer dream
The shadow of love
The shadow of rose
The shadows remain
The ship that sent you
The ship will sink on April solstice
The shoes you’ll be wearing
The shots the rays-screens shot me
The shuffling shadows
The sight that comes around the bend
The silhouette of something good
The silver lining
The simple way
The singing of a dying star
The sky does not care
The sky is empty
The sky is falling
The sky is my deck
The sky looked tender
The sky was not shaded
The sky will cover
The sleep of the subway
The smell of bad habits
The smell of hypocrisy
The smoke and the fire
The snow moving
The song is not the song
The sound of footsteps
The sound of these endless train wrecks
The sounds of morning intermission
The sparkles of affection
The sparks go from inside your heart
The speed of our dreams
The speed with which time keeps repeating
The spiritual postulate
The square me
The star
The star is set
The star on the staircase
The stars are seen higher
The stars are shining
The stars dance
The stars shake
The stars shout
The static of your paradise
The statue wall
The stone bone jaw
The streams of something lonely
The streams started to drain of colour
The streetlife ghost of fame
The streets weeps
The suffocating soul
The sun
The sun at the shore
The sun breaks in awe
The sun can be yours
The sun has risen
The sun in my eyes
The sun kissed the blue
The sun of some greatness
The sun reflected
The sun rest in my eyes
The sun smiles
The sun was shining
The sun will set at nine am
The sunken tomb
The sunlight fades away
The sunrises
The sunset
The swamp fills the night
The sweat remains
The taste of flame
The taste of sulfur
The tearful wheel
The tears flowed
The tension keeps running through my veins
The tentacle shakes
The theme of the show
The thin line
The thing with the bells
The things I try to make
The thrill of falling away
The thrill of moving across the water
The thunderstorm
The tide is round
The time flies
The time had come
The time has come to send
The times she came
The tornado flashes
The tree of the free state
The trees are falling
The true machine
The true, a shadowlike thing
The truth
The truth before all the lawsuits
The truth comes
The truth of life
The truth’s all broken
The truth’s true
The two ways
The unknown
The up and coming tickets
The urge against kings
The violence that remains
The vision
The voice in your head
The voice leads me to leave
The voice on the soundtrack
The voices
The voices have been silenced
The voices of the souls
The walls of your head
The walls shut
The warm season
The watchman
The water here, the bones under the paint
The waters call
The waters of love
The waves sound like steel
The way
The way I see it
The way she talked
The way to check somebody's dream
The way to love
The way to soul
The way we belong
The way we know
The way you come
The way you dress
The way you feel
The way you look at it
The way you talk
The wedding ring
The wet dream
The wetter shore
The whole place is quiet
The whole train wreck
The whole world's gonna dance
The widow
The wildsman
The womb of a gentleman
The wooden shack
The word wins
The words die hard
The world gets buried
The world is melting
The world is turned upside down
The world of hoeing
The world of music
The world's way
The world’s a mad place
Their dreams never end
Their haircut suit
Their nuts and bolts
Their wives talked
Then I knew
Then I look in the mirror
Then I was young again
Then a bowl of soup
Then again, they are far apart
Then don’t try harder
Then go on your merry way
Then sell his soul
Then she had found me
Then she opens the box and it’s busy
Then she’s dead
Then somehow I’ll find it
Then there was pain
Then there's nothing anymore
Then turn away, alright?
Then we both hear
Then what do you think
Then why wait?
Then you sit next to me
Then you’re free
There ain't much to lose
There are dangers inside
There are forgotten skeletons
There are my pictures
There are no newsmen
There are some minutes until tomorrow
There are times I thought I was gone
There is no avoiding this place
There is no doubt I don't get higher
There isn't time to sit down
There was me and you
There was one gentle light
There were horns on a stick
There were no waste of their money
There's lots of other people
There's no room for you
There's no time to waste
There’s no one to watch
There’s nothing like she
There’s nothing to make of it
These are love letters
These are times I want
These are your dreams
These assassins hate me
These days I can’t find you
These dead ends
These dogs bark
These dreams
These haute bourgeois days
These pants do not fit
These past days
These questions have no answers
These songs give my generation space
These strange tears
These trails to meet
These trials and tribulations
They ain't made this perfect
They began the sad days
They brought your food
They come through what’s possible
They could be dangerous
They danced outside
They didn’t reveal their secrets
They fought for what they had
They gave up on their low hopes
They get tired of me
They got right under your nose
They had no morals
They hate you
They know you’re looking through your lens
They looked at you with cold hatred
They made love
They mumble more than it’s worth
They must've gone really high
They need you
They saw you’d sit there
They say he’s my friend
They say, watch out for me
They see me
They seem indecipherable
They should at least give me the money
They started a chain reaction
They sure never knew
They take pleasure
They talked past each other
They teach how to play
They thought so
They took my life, they took my money
They understand
They wave
They were my friends
They were never gentle
They will be happy
They won't pay
They won’t look down
They worked harder for you
They'll tear us apart
They're all together
They're supposed to be like an ordinary day
They’re all wrong
They’re probably watching
They’ve got faces against mirrors
They’ve got no pulse
They’ve got the time to get locked in
They’ve watched you bleed
Things I cannot see
Things I love about her
Things I missed
Things I thought of no one else
Things seem fine
Things seem to slip away
Things start to piss you off
Things take a back seat
Things that I don’t mind
Things that didn't belong
Things that do don't matter
Things that make me laugh
Things that may or may not survive
Things that never change
Things to do
Things we could do
Things we knew
Things we talked about in my youth
Things will be better and worse
Things you can say
Things you didn’t know
Things you see and hear everyday
Things you think
Think
Think a little more
Think and think again
Think inside the mind
Think it all worth it
Think it’s wrong
Think nothing of life
Think of another
Think of my body
Think of what you’ve been through
Think you already know
Thinking about you
Thinking of everything
Thinking-glass
Third down on the scale
Third time around
Third window
This alone
This ancient cannibal killer
This baby
This call from heaven
This can't be ignored
This cauldron full of secrets
This child lives up to her name
This city will be in ruin
This feels a bit like big light
This feels like a storm
This full stop
This funeral is just before me
This game
This game - meaning so much to me
This girl’s from Maine
This hand’s open
This has nothing to do with crying baby
This hatred is contagious
This heavenly god
This human condition
This in the grass
This is a day for dialogue
This is a fickle thing
This is a good time
This is a meaningless dream
This is a spiritual grieve
This is all I have to say
This is all I have, play with me
This is destiny
This is going to be him
This is her life
This is love in a glass coffin
This is my little world
This is my me
This is my secret so deep
This is right before your eyes
This is the coolest movie I've ever seen
This is the damn place
This is the future
This is the new music
This is the real world
This is the sunshine
This is what you look for
This is where you belong
This is why I was afraid
This is your pride
This is your world
This isn't work
This land is yours
This language
This little square
This moment comes to us
This movie looks for this peace
This new flag
This old art: You’re always so interesting
This place is not what it used to be
This record is such a charm
This should be with you
This sound it made
This table
This the last time
This thing we call beauty
This thread ran out of an hour
This time I will follow’s way
This time today
This tired show
This town
This town called you
This town in the sky
This town might be free
This way’s all pretty
This will crush you
This won't have to be bad
Those assholes only get stupid
Those feet are burned
Those first snowflakes
Those flowers that used to lie on the ground
Those inside your head
Those three towers
Those two words
Those who lie
Though I looked more alive
Though darker than I am
Though that all comes crashing down
Though time might have turned
Thought all of this will be fine
Thought he had seen
Thought to be a world apart
Thoughts and chases
Thoughts could be pretty
Thoughts for some reason
Thoughts, no matter what
Thrice your wealth
Through a clear glass
Through a gap
Through a goddamned window
Through a vein
Through a window
Through and through
Through her mind
Through her nose
Through my parents
Through my soul
Through our wild angles
Through some people
Through the cemetery
Through the crack of a feather
Through the cracks
Through the crying sun
Through the dryer
Through the emptiness
Through the gate
Through the gutters
Through the haze
Through the mouth
Through the ruins
Through the sand
Through the show of time
Through the smoke from the fire
Through the stars
Through the teeth of my own band
Through the walls
Through the wild world
Through the window
Through your dreams
Throughneath
Throw a ball down
Throw away the secrets
Throw him around like a trophy
Throw it in the trash
Throw me all over yourself
Throw me into all kinds of patterns
Throw sand out of her eyes
Throw the false grin
Throw the wind in your face
Throw their hats in the ring
Throw your love away
Throw yourself apart
Throwing a call in the wind
Throwing away excuses
Throwing away his work
Throwing away my word
Throwing balls at you
Throwing his hands up
Throwing me into a mirror
Throwing stuff away
Throwing the turkey carcass
Throwing wreaths
Thunderstruck
Till I die
Till I end
Till I get myself back
Till I’m dead
Till now
Till the soul of his dreams starts to shake
Till tomorrow it must grow
Till you be called
Till you die
Till you shake
Till you surrender
Till you’re awake
Time away
Time away, Romeo and Juliet
Time burns like water
Time can turn purple
Time for a question
Time for the day
Time for the sun
Time gives me hope
Time has run out
Time here I thought
Time is at a standstill
Time is on your side
Time is running out
Time no longer the worst
Time passed
Time passes
Time passes and the sun shines
Time slips away
Time to be good
Time to climb up the bunk
Time to commit suicide
Time to dance
Time to go
Time to go the way you are
Time to grind
Time to grow stronger
Time to sing
Time to smile
Time to start anew
Time to take on ourselves
Time won't run out
Tired of being a son
Tired of feeding myself
Tired of getting down
Tired of going without you
Tired of it all
Tired of keeping the innocent silent
Tired of me seeing you
Tired of stealing love
Tired of the others
To Tender the sweet couch
To a certain extent
To a devil
To almost smile
To another world
To argue
To ask him the question
To bare the hardest battle
To be a cliche
To be alone in the sun
To be an angel
To be buried with your tail behind
To be cool with the beginning
To be free
To be in love
To be lazy
To be quiet
To be sad and angry
To break free
To break the silence
To bring love
To bring you together
To burn and drown
To burn by me
To claim the world
To come to me
To come to you
To cower so that the wind can blow
To crawl all over the border
To cry out
To cry the song
To defend the holy plant
To destroy you
To drag yourself away
To face the evil of the act
To fight the dragon
To find myself empty
To find out how I can trust the world
To find out what you mean
To find out where he came from
To find something wrong
To find things of value
To find true love
To find you
To free myself
To get away from our parents
To get close
To get rid of your faults
To get up
To get you through
To give a hand to Queen’s soup
To give a shadow
To give you a look
To go for the perfect match
To go on the rampage
To grow up
To grow up so young
To guide you
To have your hand
To her ecstasy
To hide the truth
To hide yourself
To keep my memory away
To know my innermost thoughts
To know you're my friend
To leave you running
To linger here for another generation
To listen to you
To live in ruins
To live with kings
To make a game you were right
To make her hangover
To make it out alive
To make me look good
To make myself stronger
To make thee tremble
To make you use this power
To make you want to lose your peace
To me
To me you sound so old
To move there
To my fourth year
To need a bit more
To order somebody else
To pack you in
To paint down a statue
To paint your father
To pass my mind
To pierce all walls
To play games of dying
To prepare myself
To prove you men
To prove you wrong
To pull it up
To push your head to the ground
To reach the end of the road
To reach the great father
To relieve herself
To reveal his love
To ride it in one
To run so fast
To say the wildest thing to someone
To search for my body
To see his shit right now
To see the diamonds cut off my hair
To see the world in a lather
To see what’s around you
To see you
To serve the devil
To share my defeat with you
To share that love
To sit alone in our honeymoon
To sit and watch her life change
To sit with a statue
To sleep safely
To some leitmotif
To sow sorrows
To spare my son
To spark your skill
To speak truthfully
To stay alive
To stay the same
To support the dreams
To take a knife edge
To take a leap
To take you apart
To tease a little kid
To tempt you
To the dusty cemetery
To the extreme
To the eyes of his own people
To the land of the wild
To the least
To the moon
To the town I grew up in
To the tune of Tom Baker records
To the west
To think of you
To touch every corner
To touch ourselves
To touch you and your dark sides
To try and hang ourselves
To turn into a petrified animal
To turn me away
To turn through your infinite nights
To use your enthusiasm for me
To wake a broken heart
To watch money fly
To what you had to say
To where they go wrong
To win up all that you missed
To you and me
Today
Today I know what you’re feeling
Today I’ve had that fear
Today it was dark
Today you can ride the dark forces
Told in our bones
Told me everything
Told me to hide my face
Told to share
Told you she was dead
Told you so, fucking shame
Tomorrow
Tomorrow is mine
Tomorrow may be a nightmare
Tomorrow we wake
Tomorrow will be changing
Tomorrow would be fine
Tomorrow ’s the party time
Tomorrow’s getting better
Tonight
Tonight I love
Too busy thinking
Too cold to be a lover
Too deep for your head
Too early
Too fucked up for you
Too fucking bitter
Too fucking complicated
Too good to be true
Too heavy
Too late to say goodbye
Too low for fame
Too many people
Too much and too little
Too much honey
Too much money
Too much time is spent
Too much to do
Too slow to call out your name
Too slow, too slow
Too strong for you
Too tired to feel
Too tired to have begun
Too weird to say goodbye
Took advantage
Took care of me
Took everything from you
Took her for a ride
Took her outside with me
Took it too far
Took my eyes off of me
Took my picture
Took my sister there
Took no break
Took the girl away
Took you by surprise
Took you by your hand
Took you to hell
Took you to supper
Top of the mountain
Totally cool
Totally gonna sell you
Totally home in his mind
Totally never gonna look the same
Totally ornery
Totally out in the open
Touch me
Touch me when you cry
Touch me with that lousy guitar
Touch me, please
Touch my bed with her fingers
Touch my breasts
Touch of eternal peace
Touch your skin
Touching you like some emotion
Toy and the treasure I am
Trans fats get wasted
Trapped and stuck
Trapped in a fire
Trapped in a prison cell
Trapped in that silent place
Trapped, dead, trapped
Trapping together
Travel
Travel a thousand miles
Treasure and the magic
Treasure in a glass jar
Tried to be trash
Tried to catch you
Tried to make you look comfortable
Tried to relate
True God
True and a ghost
True doge
True in Hollywood
True life and an hourglass vision
True truth
Trust
Try
Try and let the nightmare end
Try getting away
Try not to wake up someone
Try this together
Try to change your mind
Try to come back
Try to hear your frustration
Try to keep me warm
Try to make it’s nice
Try to see him a while in the haze
Trying hard to survive
Trying to be popular
Trying to befriend new people
Trying to bounce
Trying to catch a flight
Trying to get away
Trying to get it to leave me alone
Trying to lie
Trying to make sense
Trying to make the happy ones
Trying to ruin his glory
Trying to salvage something
Trying to seduce him
Trying to waltz out
Trying to win by splitting pixels
Tune in every goddamn hour
Tune in for a run
Tune in how you feel
Tune your windows
Turn and run
Turn around
Turn around and take it back
Turn around in my mind
Turn down my music
Turn inside out
Turn it off from dawn
Turn me back
Turn my career around
Turn on the display
Turn the rainbows down
Turn your arms around me
Turn your song around
Turned down the street
Turned down yesterday
Turned into a drain
Turned me round
Turned out like this
Turned out to be great
Turned to steam
Turning blue
Turning clear and tidy
Turning down from a mission
Turning into my body
Turning it on
Turning me down
Turning off your game
Turning our back on you
Turning the weight of my concerns
Twelve miles down the highway
Twelve rap songs this time
Twelve years I've walked the streets
Twenty-five minutes on the clock
Twentyfour patches of paint
Two bars
Two big worries
Two blows out
Two bright years
Two children keeping their faces up
Two colours
Two footprints
Two good times we could have known
Two holes of sliver
Two laws
Two little sad horses
Two rings
Two sides of the same coin
Uggshells
Ugly look
Ummmmm, how can I sit on my hands?
Unapologetically helpful
Unbreakable dreams
Uncharacteristic success
Unconstitutionally rude to others
Under God's authority
Under an absent night
Under my mattress
Under the half moon
Under the saddle
Under the shadow
Under the shadows
Under the skin
Under the stage
Under the tree
Under this curse
Underneath every shattered lock
Underneath his yawn
Underneath my hair
Underneath the creeper boats
Underneath the heavy rain
Underneath the sky
Underneath this haze
Underneath your despair
Underneath your heat
Underserved visions
Understanding everything
Understood
Undertale
Unfailing
Unfolding the leads
Uninvited
Uninvited from sight
Unknown
Unlike life
Unsold secrets
Unsparing for you
Until I can do something
Until I lose my mind
Until he ends up with me
Until her grandpa found her
Until last time
Until my face is clear
Until no one wants it
Until now
Until the beast dies
Until they show up
Until tomorrow
Until you are ready
Until you throw my arse at me
Unwrap the fire
Up above the cloud
Up and down
Up and down in a million ways
Up and out
Up close and personal
Up comes the rose
Up for anything
Up here
Up in hell
Up in the sky
Up on the freedom top of the star
Up right then and up there
Up the route
Up to now
Up to that number
Up to their bank
Upcoming justice
Upending the romance
Upon the craggy line
Upstairs
Used a spoon
Used her fingers
Used up the patience
Used your false soap
Using as a weapon
Using them as a commercial asset
Using your mercy
Utter word of the Crown
V-Day of consent
Vain to lose
Vanished
Vanished from you
Vanishing in my vision
Vanishing my mind
Vanquish the cold
Verbal violence
Very fine
Very funny
Very interesting story
Very nice example
Very scary
Very soon will we let the stars start to fade
Very strange blue
Very tender
Very tired
Very violent
Very well
Violence, hate, violence
Violent act
Visions
Visions and memory
Visions dancing in the wind
Visions of broken hearts
Visions of his fingers
Visions of mankind
Visions of my own death
Visions of painting
Visions of ruin
Visions of the sea
Visions that will change forever
Voices to entertain
Voices within me
Voices you can hear
Vomit me
Vomiting white and red
Voting for Colgate
Voting for oil
Vows to tear you apart
V’s still alive
Wait for the new day
Wait for the rest of the world
Waiting for a boy
Waiting for a burst
Waiting for a kick in the ears
Waiting for a scream
Waiting for a sign
Waiting for another dream
Waiting for night
Waiting for one of these worlds
Waiting for something
Waiting for the perfect day
Waiting for the rain
Waiting for the sea
Waiting for the sky to warm
Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the truth
Waiting for the world to turn
Waiting for them
Waiting for tomorrow
Waiting for you to be satisfied
Waiting for you to come
Waiting for you to die
Waiting for you to find it
Waiting for you to pass
Waiting for your hollow
Waiting for your master
Waiting for your song
Waiting to be taunted
Waiting to catch up
Waiting to meet you
Waiting to wake
Wake in the middle of the night
Wake me up
Wake me up at home
Wake up now
Wake up tomorrow morning
Wake up your mouth
Waking in their quiet
Waking up
Waking up as a tired dog
Waking up drunk
Waking up in the middle of the night
Waking up to a vision
Walk around
Walk around trying to cheat
Walk by my window
Walk down the street
Walk down to a soulless corner
Walk in the stars
Walk our corridors
Walk with me
Walk your life away
Walked past eyes
Walking across the road
Walking across the stage
Walking around inside me
Walking around like the darkness
Walking around on the street
Walking as fuck
Walking away
Walking behind the curtain
Walking down the dark path
Walking down the street
Walking from a volcano
Walking in free will
Walking in on my victim
Walking in the black
Walking in the night
Walking like a lost soul
Walking on water
Walking out from your slumber
Walking out onto your town
Walking the streets
Walking through life
Walking through town
Walking to the sun
Walking with my hands
Wall by wall
Wall of a bottle
Wall of death
Walls across time
Walls thin and proud
Walls too high
Want me naked
Want me on all this?
Want the words
Want to be the master of my destiny
Want to know, how you got where?
Want to play the rules?
Want to stop and sit?
Wanted it all for the third time
Wanted to give someone
Wanting to play
War asks me to surrender
War on the wall
War to slow down
Warm memories
Warm stuff to change
Warmaster, warlord
Warning
Was born just to be alone
Was it supposed to be about your lives?
Was that your king?
Wash away the ashes
Wash it away
Wash the ship
Wasn't right here
Watch as a weapon
Watch as the summertime brightens
Watch his hand on my shoulder
Watch how you roll my memory
Watch me from behind
Watch me singing
Watch my face
Watch my heart turn
Watch out on the lonesome corridors
Watch the sun shine
Watch your heart skip a beat
Watched you smile
Watcher of life
Watching TV
Watching birds from cloud tops
Watching for me
Watching her fall
Watching him tremble
Watching his eyes come and go
Watching his face
Watching in the distance
Watching music
Watching my mother die
Watching people die
Watching starfish crawl
Watching the future
Watching the love seed snake
Watching the same old movie
Watching the silver tongue
Watching the sun rise
Watching the sun set
Watching their wings burn
Watching themselves fade
Watching us fall
Watching you burn
Watching you shower
Watching you struggle with booze
Water and mist
Water falls
Water in the sky
Water to his heart
Waterfalls
Waves back down again
Waves shimmer around
Waving down a tree
Way down here—there’s a hole in the heart
Way down on the dragoon
Way to understand
Way up here
We
We all came down blind
We all die
We all have our minds on us
We all met at the zoo
We all started talking
We almost forgot...
We always knew he was gonna die
We always lived at sea
We are a gang of deceit
We are all together
We are going to need you
We are gone
We are his own rules
We are in the line of attack
We are like a fake
We are my own creation
We are nothing but dead old people
We are part of another rainbow
We are parted lips
We are running out
We are so scared
We are still at the bridge
We are the river
We are yours
We both share
We broke with that law
We call you our lovers
We can call you saint
We can go in this way
We can only dream
We can sing
We can walk down the street
We can't go nowhere
We can't ride you away
We can. Like putting my mind on it
We care not who dies
We come from the east
We come so late
We could die alone
We could find a way
We created him
We danced a little differently
We did it differently
We did it together
We didn't do anything to us
We die singing in his breast
We don't know why
We don't love you
We don’t belong here
We don’t see it’s long ago
We don’t talk much
We each must pay attention
We feel good
We flew across the sky
We found the same news
We gave everything away
We gave up when you told us the news
We go on sailing boards
We go, go
We got people
We got some bad news
We grew apart
We had a beer when it came time
We had a shadow
We had friends dead for generations
We had lost control
We had no control
We had seen my sides
We had to be beside ourselves
We have good eyes
We have known each other for years
We have never met
We hear you’re blowing a match
We just burst with laughter
We just gotta get to our friends
We just met
We just sold out
We killed ourselves
We know it’s a good game
We know something’s wrong
We know you’re dead
We laid flowers
We landed safely
We live in a nice place
We live in a picture
We lived in the moment
We look back at you
We made money
We made promises
We might let the shard go
We move past that unspoken tension
We must stay together
We need someone to look after us
We need to get home
We need to hear you
We need to stop pretending
We need you more
We never knew what we were
We ought to be together
We parted like a wave
We pass down the music
We pay for his milk
We reach across and around you
We reach the middle of nowhere
We really fucked up
We saved that woman
We saw him crying
We saw it all
We see the same concept
We shall bring our own children
We shall see you every morning
We share our thoughts
We should come together
We should forget him
We should go
We should leave a trail
We shouldn't pay attention to you
We sold all our hearts
We sold ourselves
We stand together
We start again
We stay here forever
We took you out of it
We turn down his cow
We used to be kindred spirits
We walk through a dream
We wanna shoot the shit from below
We wanted the music
We will eat together
We will face each other
We will make them go away
We will never meet
We will probably meet again
We will ride it out
We won't be rid of you
We won't be together
We won't give him away
We'll do it together
We'll find him
We'll take care of each other
We're all heading up for one day
We're gonna get there
We're just fucking away
We're no longer dead
We're not yet inside
We've been friends
We've been living within ourselves
We've got a deal
We've got our sympathy
We've heard his name in the room
We've left here
We've lost a God
Wear it all over your clothes
Wear your soul
Wearing no shoes
Weaving stream of sound
Welcome to paradise
Welcome to the crazy land
Welcome to the crazy lands
Well I know where you’re parked
Well I’m worried
Well done
Well done today
Well hello, you’re looking down
Well here comes the good news
Well it depends on where you're at
Well let me just say
Well my pity
Well one night in the grindhouse
Well that will be fair
Well, I don’t mind
Well, John Toques
Well, that has gone too far
Well, we're gonna get out
Well, you must be forgetting
Well, you’re a businessman
Well, you’re so late
Weren't they very kind?
Weren't we yesterday?
Wet dream day
Wet moving mirror
Wet o' dust
Wet, sweaty things
We’ll all cry
We’ll be crying
We’ll be moving in different directions
We’ll get you wet
We’ll meet tomorrow
We’ll not be so old
We’ll ride
We’ll see you soon
We’re all friends
We’re all in love
We’re all insane
We’re all lying
We’re all stuck together
We’re all turned upside down
We’re both dead
We’re doing it right
We’re just waiting for you
We’re like pirates
We’re looking for it
We’re outside
We’re torn apart
We’re young and want to fly
We’ve all been scared
We’ve all taken my fingers
We’ve been the best
We’ve got nothing to hide
We’ve got to pass on
What I can do
What I cannot help you
What I know
What I need
What I once thought to be a beautiful art
What I used to love
What I was good at
What a blessed day
What a lie
What a pit of beasts
What a time to be alive
What about me?
What about you
What am I to know
What an almost noble goal
What an incredible part
What are we doing now?
What are you afraid to say?
What are you doing today?
What are you’re saying to yourself
What began as a thousand hearts
What can I say?
What color flowers sing
What did I say?
What did you tell me?
What do I get paid to do?
What do I know’s happening
What do we do now
What do we mean by saying we don't care?
What do we say tomorrow?
What do you call me?
What do you mean by it?
What do you think?
What do you want?
What else do you suppose?
What else will he do
What ends up in your eyes
What feeling like contact means
What he will do
What if it’s broken down and torn apart?
What if you don't want to go?
What is a trick
What is it really?
What is the beauty of yours?
What is the big deal?
What is this place called?
What is wrong with me
What isn't to fear?
What kind of sales do you know?
What life’s all about
What made you think I could escape?
What makes my nights different
What matters here
What men can do
What now?
What really matters is today
What she called my portrait
What the hell am I doing here?
What the hell do you mean?
What they say
What took you so long?
What was the pain?
What we do
What we had stood for
What we have been waiting for
What will I do to your affection ?
What will be done
What will you do?
What will you say?
What would you do?
What you did to me
What you don’t know
What you dream
What you expect
What you look like in a photograph
What you spent your time doing
What you would like to know?
What you’re doing
What you’ve been waiting for
What you’ve got left
What you’ve seen
What's next?
What's the meaning?
What's the reason?
What's wrong with her?
What's your boss supposed to say?
What?
Whatever you have received
What’s all those paintings out there?
What’s going to happen now?
What’s wrong
When I could live
When I finally got one
When I finally got tired
When I last saw you
When I met you
When I ran away from them
When I sat
When I say I was pleased
When I say goodbye
When I say that first time
When I stop talking
When I tried to reach them
When I was gonna cry
When I’m a woman
When I’m around
When I’m doing it right
When I’m like this
When all comes crashing down
When anyone’s coming over
When did you get down here?
When did you reach so high?
When didn’t you hear?
When ever that moment comes true
When fate kills
When he comes home
When he pulls through
When it ain't white
When it comes down to what I know
When it comes out
When it comes time for me
When it comes to boobs
When it rains
When it’s too late
When it’s warm in the sun
When little ones always want him
When my smiling eyes meet my shadow
When others cry
When our hands touch
When she looked at me with blank eyes
When she smiles
When should we go?
When someone else brings you money
When the breasts’re gone
When the butterfly sat down
When the enemy comes on the attack
When the rope fell apart
When the sun glowed
When the sun shines
When the world dies
When there are no restrictions
When there is nothing I can do
When they do
When they know you are there
When they let you in
When they’re long gone
When this clock goes off
When we became poor
When we come home
When we get down on our hands
When we meet again
When we went across the street
When we’ll meet again
When we’re all together
When will it end?
When you are all gone
When you become satisfied
When you didn’t belong
When you drag yourself down
When you emerge into the daylight
When you gotta push it to the ground
When you leave me now
When you look at her
When you see me
When you touch her eyes
When you're done
When you’re inside
When you’re pretty
When you’re standing beside me
Whenever I walk on shore
Whenever I was young
Whenever the night came light
Whenever they say I'm wrong
When’s a girl with the right or wrong
Where I can hang out
Where I come from
Where I don’t wish you knew
Where I go after my windup
Where I live
Where I sit from now on
Where I stay
Where I’d leave you
Where I’m bending over backwards
Where all of you were
Where all the Christian money went
Where all the way to hell
Where are you when you need me?
Where are you?
Where could we go?
Where did you go
Where did your name come from?
Where do you go now?
Where do you want to go
Where do you want to go?
Where dreams come true
Where everything goes
Where he can kiss
Where he said salvation comes out
Where it gets harder
Where it’s loud and proud
Where it’s night
Where men like that
Where might we hide
Where my brother never seen
Where night is a mist
Where none stood
Where old men came from
Where our enemies will lie
Where she goes inside
Where still you come
Where the country lies
Where the crying is
Where the devil is stalking you
Where the dreams were from
Where the future leads
Where the heart really is
Where the law's been broken
Where the money was yesterday
Where the moon
Where the music stops
Where the pain is now
Where the sun shines
Where the trail leads to…
Where the wind is blowing
Where there are long forgotten rooms
Where there is a black hole
Where they belong
Where they lived the rest of their lives
Where those pictures are taken
Where time is running out
Where to sing
Where we go
Where we live
Where we want to be
Where will she go?
Where will you go?
Where you are’re standing
Where you belong
Where you gonna go?
Where you went wrong
Where your mouth sinks
Where's my ass?
Where's my diamond?
Where's the bathroom?
Where's the soup?
Wherein I hide?
Wherever I could be
Wherever I go
Wherever he’s lying
Wherever the fun's been brought
Wherever you can ride
Wherever you come from
Wherever you end up
Wherever you wanna be
Which door is the other side
Which is why I want you
While I lay lying there
While I wait for the month to come
While I'm still in love
While I’m busy crying
While I’m flying
While a dinosaur bird’s head falls
While a person hangs his head
While crying
While everybody else is away
While he always ran for her
While he stands and waits
While he's looking for you
While in prison
While moving across time
While my flesh’s cracked
While nowhere to hide
While she rakes in your money
While the sun's not shining
While the sun's shining
While the wind blows
While there’s violence
While they are here
While we did sleep
While we wait
While women keep running away
While you are looking down
While you can’t look away
While you hang in there
While you lie awake
While you were watching
Whisper a street sobriety breath
Whispering canyons
White as silk
White bubbles
White hand
White horse head
White is broken
White out with the sun
White pearl tint
White rhinestone streets
White things
Whitebird
Who cares?
Who dares to touch you?
Who doesn't believe in divine power?
Who gets home the best?
Who wants love from their lips?
Who will take us back?
Who wouldn’t play me?
Who's in the box
Who?
Whoopee now
Whose baby’s to know?
Whose eternal dreams
Whose love’s been lost
Who’d you meet?
Who’s a giant?
Who’s all you need
Who’s at fault here?
Who’s doing it?
Who’s got no fight left
Who’s got your star?
Who’s impressed?
Who’s really the king
Who’s right?
Who’s running around?
Who’s standing?
Why I hate you
Why am I here?
Why can't we just stop seeing?
Why can't you sleep at home
Why did we lose all hope?
Why didn't you just move my arm?
Why do you feel so sorry?
Why do you need me?
Why don't you pay the bill?
Why else can't you sleep?
Why has it all been left to us?
Why has it been so long since I did?
Why if she shouldn't go
Why is it time to change your image?
Why isn't anyone doing it?
Why must I?
Why you want to dance?
Why you’re off to a great start
Why’ve you never been the same?
Wild and wild
Wild creatures afraid
Wilder than I remembered
Will all the weeping be kept alive?
Will do anything
Will it kill me?
Will make our moonshine
Will never feel free
Will no one spare you?
Will pass that time
Will you ever stop?
Will you join us tomorrow
Will you keep eating through me?
Will you love me a little more?
Will your boss get up tomorrow?
Winds of revolution
Wintertime
Wipe it all out of me
Wipe me from my soul
Wipe our records clean
Wipe you dry
Wiped out in the graveyard
Wiping the leaves
Wish I could take it easy
Wish I hadn't been here
Wish I would die
Wish me a bigger red cloak
Wished for God
Wishing for the sun
Wishing nothing but paradise
Wishing you new lives
With God there
With a ball of fur
With a boy
With a companion in tow
With a dog
With a gaze of pity
With a grin
With a headache
With a nickel to the dollar
With a question mark
With a secret heart
With a shadow of my face
With a smile
With all our bullets
With all that I see
With all the people in it
With an old friend
With another salute
With blue eyes
With bones to kill
With clear eyes
With devotion’s eyes
With every trick
With everything in her mind
With hearts full of blood
With her eyes
With her shadow
With his still bleeding eye
With it for you
With lips that have now sold it
With low hopes
With luck
With most people
With my lips wide open
With my lust and my love
With my mind
With no voice I’m gonna go
With notes written down
With our support
With out the misery
With peace
With purpose
With some surprise
With somebody else
With sorrows of everlasting fire
With the drug’s punishment
With the good plan
With the jam and the laughter
With the light of day
With the mamma's ring
With the promise of tomorrow
With the soldiers and killers
With their hovels
With time comes your own reality
With unfettered love
With violence and love
With what is left
With white clothes
With wings dark and red
With wings on your legs
With you down and with us
With your blood collection
With your money
With your new-found strength
With your sky
Within a month
Within six or seven hundred yards
Within the shadows
Without God
Without bells
Without getting into this deep silence
Without him
Without protection
Without searching
Without the sun
Without thinking
Without us
Woe is me
Woke up in a furnace
Won't go away
Won't know what you need
Won't let anybody else know
Won't lose her sweet face
Won't make you happy
Won't move the shame
Won't nobody go
Won't that be pretty?
Wonder
Wonder the nation
Wonder what we forgot?
Wonder why you’ve gotta be here
Wonderful prison
Wonderful stage
Wondering for life
Wondering why there is no tomorrow
Won’t forget
Won’t hold in your arms
Won’t look
Won’t lose my share
Won’t they please you?
Woolly
Woolly whale
Work up tonight
Worked like hell
Working just to hold it together
Working on a painting
Working without thought
World and race
Worn out
Would I lie
Would be out of time
Would you leave me alone
Would you lie under the stars
Would you like to dance to it
Wouldn't be a mistake
Wouldn't it be funny if he’s loved again
Wouldn't you be happy?
Wouldn't you like a lil' light
Wound up
Wrangling a chorus
Written in an iron chair
Wrongs of the city
Yeah I saw it in the flag
Yeah I’m talking to the bells
Yeah but there is no escape
Yeah okay I need to be fast
Yeah so knowing I love you
Yeah they’re gonna keep doing
Yeah this time
Yeah you go
Yeah, I guess
Yeah, I know what you mean
Yeah, I’ve got it called
Yeah, alright
Yeah, as the morning opens
Yeah, can't be anything good
Yeah, come on for a ride
Yeah, it’s easy to be lazy
Yeah, okay
Yeah, that had been a bit heavy
Yeah, there's some key
Yeah, they call me that
Yeah, we're friendly
Yeah, what’s the point?
Yeah...
Years pass in silence
Years without fireworks
Yellow snout
Yellow things need you
Yes
Yes to call you so
Yes, bring me no pain
Yes, please don’t let me down
Yes, really quite comfortably
Yes, right
Yes, the old way
Yes, this was right around the corner
Yes, we will
Yes, yes, please
Yes, yes, yes I’m bored
Yes... we’ve got no success
Yesterday
You ain't free
You ain't really home
You ain’t there to hide
You all know
You all pushed me away
You and I get together everyday
You and I’ve met
You and me in the street
You are always crying
You are exactly where I ought to be
You are going crazy
You are me
You are my role model
You are okay
You are so tired
You are so young
You are the charm
You are wondering
You aren't very fat
You are’re the top monster
You asked him if…
You belong in my store
You call this her treasure
You can believe it's happening
You can call me seductive
You can decide what you want
You can do my thing
You can feel my arms around you
You can feel so alive
You can fix yourself
You can get paid more than I’m asking for
You can have life
You can live on the moon
You can probably beat me
You can see it now
You can see that past
You can see the laws
You can smell her hair
You can take it on
You can touch a key
You can touch me
You can't be me
You cannot believe it
You can’t help it’s so blank
You can’t think of another name
You come through with me
You could be mine
You could be wrong
You could get your life together
You could have paid a fine
You could smell those innocent things
You could teach me a lesson
You did it by force
You did the right thing
You didn’t know
You died pretty bad
You don't do much till today
You don't feel so good
You don't need me
You don't want to go alone
You don't want to go home
You don’t deserve to be around me
You don’t do something
You don’t go all summer long
You don’t have the answer
You don’t have to say it today
You don’t know
You don’t know it’s this way
You don’t know me
You don’t know what’s wrong
You don’t want to call your name
You forgot to pay the grandmaster
You fought through some stupid game
You found your way in
You gave away everything
You gave me a parade
You get close to heaven
You get goosebumps
You get low
You get on better with life
You get this’s a secret
You go down my broken path
You go out in high school
You got one a minute ago
You gotta go away
You gotta pick my brain
You gotta think good of me
You had it all figured out
You had never done him a favour
You have all the money
You have been made fun of
You have just done it
You have my heart
You have no tomorrow
You have things in your heart
You have to be brave
You have to have empathy
You hear the bells day and night
You heard about that
You hold in your hands
You hold on to what you say
You just can’t help it
You keep crying
You keep dying
You keep walking
You kept trying to kill me
You knew I’m coming to stop
You knew the same
You know I’m getting up
You know I’ve seen the same patterns
You know how I feel
You know how to make my heart sing
You know it’s hard
You know my title
You know she’d follow me home
You know that you know
You know what
You know what I mean?
You know what I'm afraid
You know what you feel
You know what you say
You know what you think
You know what? I can’t be your muse
You know when you do
You know who I’m gonna kill
You know why
You know you’re a failure
You know you’re in for a ride
You know you’re into it
You know, you’re good
You left the army out in the open
You let him stay with you
You like a picture
You live alone
You live at peace with a fool
You look around the room
You look like you, or you don't come close
You look like you’d been here before
You look ready
You look so sad
You look strong
You look tired
You lost us
You made it through
You made it to prison
You made me laugh
You made my soup
You make it hard for me
You may as well just go find yourself
You may have to keep in mind
You mean it’s you?
You meet another human?
You must be single
You must belong
You must quit right now
You must win tomorrow
You never can forget
You never get to pick your wife
You never knew
You never know
You never stopped sobbing
You never walk through that door
You now become bored
You said you wanted to go home
You saw me just standing there
You say
You say it with that feeling in your eyes
You say it's down to your bones
You say you want it too
You see
You see how far we get
You see it from time to time
You see me now
You see the fruit of my sweat
You see you’re here
You see?
You seem so new
You seem surprised
You seem very different
You started walking right there
You stay away
You stay the night
You still want to sing
You take the shine off your blue
You take the spiritual home
You talk with the dog
You told me
You took control
You took it away
You took no credit
You tried so hard
You used to be a wallflower
You used to be happy
You wanna dance naked?
You wanna go home?
You want it crazy
You want it right now
You want me to see things
You want to be free
You want to be funny
You watched me hide in a corner
You were growing too slow
You were looking down
You were prepared
You were the idol of the morning
You will be master of my mind
You will do so
You will do whatever you like
You will find me
You will love me
You won't get through this
You won't give me money
You won't seem the wiser
You won’t be so lonely
You won’t get nowhere
You won’t lose your soul
You won’t make it through
You won’t pay the rent
You won’t walk
You're a bar
You're all alone
You're fucking my soul
You're gonna hit the ground running
You're just gonna wake up next door
You're mine
You're upset, we can just sit here and weep
You've brought it from hell
You've got me there
You've got your ears wide open
You, it’s up to you
Young Mary is half asleep
Young and beautiful
Young blood's wounds are running like hail
Young cats
Young chums
Young crack dreams
Young men just like me
Young men laughing
Your acts just disappoint
Your belief in a shadow
Your biggest mistake
Your blood hangs over the river
Your blood on my green park
Your blood will beat me
Your blue
Your bones belong on his shoulder
Your broken back
Your broomstroke
Your choice
Your daily responsibilities
Your devil for me
Your dirty little sheets
Your dirty mind
Your door’s got one weird one
Your ears call
Your eye should have been shining
Your eyes
Your eyes never match
Your fame and your troubles
Your father and his money
Your father must be gone
Your fever sufferer’s created
Your friend
Your fucking own home
Your ghost can’t see
Your golden age
Your ground floor gangsta
Your habit
Your hand on my heart
Your hand with him
Your hard-earned cash
Your hatred so light
Your heart beats in a jar
Your heart is singing
Your heart will freeze
Your high is my high
Your holy name
Your house was built just the other day
Your image as a pillow
Your imagination had me
Your invincible old self
Your juice and nothing else
Your last feeling
Your legs are deceiving
Your life could be a lie
Your life for your day
Your life is a mystery
Your life is meant to be pretty
Your life is no longer a cakewalk
Your lips are never free
Your lips hurt
Your lives don’t seem all that different
Your love became human
Your love for your life
Your love is at last a clue
Your love is calling
Your love is eternal
Your lovely little sister
Your make it shine
Your medicine brings me to nowhere
Your mind is nothing else
Your mind is so full of simple blue
Your mom will make you laugh
Your more pressing duty
Your mother promised me death
Your mother said my adage's up
Your mother’s words
Your nerves are getting up
Your next job
Your old life
Your passion is growing
Your place of honour
Your plan is only to kill a warning
Your present moon
Your pretty eyes don’t hurt
Your pride turned into pride
Your protection is indecent
Your rages from under the tent
Your rights look rusty
Your ring of thunder
Your roots got buried
Your royal heart
Your sad shell
Your saint’s name
Your scarred voice
Your senseless laughter
Your sex is so messed up
Your shadow opens your eyes
Your ship is the planet
Your silhouette walks down the road
Your sister's wrestling style
Your skin is alive
Your skin is dying
Your smile clearly set ablaze
Your songs turned me on
Your soul
Your soul is insensible
Your soul won’t be long
Your stomach’s on fire
Your success
Your support
Your tears start falling
Your teeth could hurt
Your thoughts belong within me
Your toys don't move
Your trash talk
Your understanding is frightful
Your unholy drama
Your use and reproach
Your vision will be violent
Your voice is fucking in the distance
Your voice notes
Your wheels turn
Your white hair
Your world is just a piece of stone
You’ll always be a part of my mind
You’ll be alright
You’ll be here someday
You’ll be making my heart full of nails
You’ll be my friend
You’ll be okay
You’ll be sorry
You’ll die in this world
You’ll die tonight
You’ll find another statue
You’ll find me
You’ll find me in a restaurant
You’ll go, you and me
You’ll have it in you
You’ll have it yours
You’ll know no more
You’ll like this
You’ll live forever
You’ll look great
You’ll love me
You’ll make me feel good
You’ll meet your future
You’ll need me
You’ll never catch me
You’ll never feel so nice
You’ll never find the word
You’ll never get there
You’ll never know
You’ll never see
You’ll never understand
You’ll not be afraid
You’re a beautiful girl
You’re a bruiser
You’re a dream
You’re a giant strap
You’re a gung-ho gun
You’re a merry song
You’re a nuisance
You’re a one of them
You’re a red pill
You’re a tortoise
You’re a traitor
You’re a voice
You’re a waste of time
You’re a weed
You’re afraid
You’re all I need
You’re all in my eyes
You’re all still alive
You’re alone
You’re always there
You’re an idol
You’re been around for so long
You’re being pigheaded
You’re bringing a night in her head
You’re buried in sorrow
You’re called light
You’re coming home
You’re crazy
You’re crying
You’re dead
You’re feeling a little wistful
You’re feeling so bad
You’re feeling so ugly
You’re fine
You’re floating
You’re giving it away
You’re going mad
You’re going to be a gentleman
You’re going to send me inside
You’re going to stay here forever
You’re gonna hate yourself
You’re gotta help me
You’re here to pay the rent
You’re here to stay
You’re in love
You’re in me
You’re in the parade
You’re insane
You’re inside
You’re just a poor cat
You’re just joking
You’re just living
You’re like me
You’re looking at the road
You’re looking through this slate
You’re mad at me
You’re making so much noise
You’re mine
You’re my lover
You’re my man
You’re my old darlings
You’re never there
You’re no stranger
You’re not an idiot
You’re not asking for anything
You’re not even strong
You’re not gonna let me sleep
You’re not real
You’re not standing down
You’re not supposed to hear
You’re not the only one to love
You’re on your own
You’re one of our moviestars
You’re only a prince
You’re really alone
You’re so beautiful
You’re so calm
You’re so free
You’re so maddening
You’re so the big test
You’re standing here tonight
You’re still on the verge of getting higher
You’re supposed to be a sorrowful artist
You’re supposed to be your king
You’re talking about the immense spark
You’re telling me everything
You’re the best boy
You’re the future
You’re the reason I had to move in
You’re the star
You’re tired of lying
You’re to blame
You’re ugly
You’re up high
You’re waiting
You’re walking through circles
You’re watching me
You’re weak
You’re wearing face
You’ve all died
You’ve been here for so long
You’ve been shot
You’ve been touched
You’ve been waiting for me
You’ve got a feeling
You’ve got a fire in your brain
You’ve got a time there
You’ve got half the weight
You’ve got no right to complain
You’ve got no words
You’ve got nothing
You’ve got nothing to lose
You’ve got some shoes to fill
You’ve got to feed me my nuts
You’ve got to get through it
You’ve got to go home
You’ve gotta be tired
You’ve heard me say once
You’ve never been apart
You’ve never met
You’ve never met me
You’ve never really had a thought
You’ve no remedy
You’ve no time to hide
You’ve not been ruled the man
You’ve only been asleep for two days
You’ve only got one problem
You’ve seen it all
You’ve seen me stare
You’ve seen me walk my highroad
You’ve seen your reflection
You’ve spent your life stuck behind
