You’ve spent your life stuck behind
You’ve seen your reflection
You’ve seen me walk my highroad
You’ve seen me stare
You’ve seen it all
You’ve only got one problem
You’ve only been asleep for two days
You’ve not been ruled the man
You’ve no time to hide
You’ve no remedy
You’ve never really had a thought
You’ve never met me
You’ve never met
You’ve never been apart
You’ve heard me say once
You’ve gotta be tired
You’ve got to go home
You’ve got to get through it
You’ve got to feed me my nuts
You’ve got some shoes to fill
You’ve got nothing to lose
You’ve got nothing
You’ve got no words
You’ve got no right to complain
You’ve got half the weight
You’ve got a time there
You’ve got a fire in your brain
You’ve got a feeling
You’ve been waiting for me
You’ve been touched
You’ve been shot
You’ve been here for so long
You’ve all died
You’re wearing face
You’re weak
You’re watching me
You’re walking through circles
You’re waiting
You’re up high
You’re ugly
You’re to blame
You’re tired of lying
You’re the star
You’re the reason I had to move in
You’re the future
You’re the best boy
You’re telling me everything
You’re talking about the immense spark
You’re supposed to be your king
You’re supposed to be a sorrowful artist
You’re still on the verge of getting higher
You’re standing here tonight
You’re so the big test
You’re so maddening
You’re so free
You’re so calm
You’re so beautiful
You’re really alone
You’re only a prince
You’re one of our moviestars
You’re on your own
You’re not the only one to love
You’re not supposed to hear
You’re not standing down
You’re not real
You’re not gonna let me sleep
You’re not even strong
You’re not asking for anything
You’re not an idiot
You’re no stranger
You’re never there
You’re my old darlings
You’re my man
You’re my lover
You’re mine
You’re making so much noise
You’re mad at me
You’re looking through this slate
You’re looking at the road
You’re like me
You’re just living
You’re just joking
You’re just a poor cat
You’re inside
You’re insane
You’re in the parade
You’re in me
You’re in love
You’re here to stay
You’re here to pay the rent
You’re gotta help me
You’re gonna hate yourself
You’re going to stay here forever
You’re going to send me inside
You’re going to be a gentleman
You’re going mad
You’re giving it away
You’re floating
You’re fine
You’re feeling so ugly
You’re feeling so bad
You’re feeling a little wistful
You’re dead
You’re crying
You’re crazy
You’re coming home
You’re called light
You’re buried in sorrow
You’re bringing a night in her head
You’re being pigheaded
You’re been around for so long
You’re an idol
You’re always there
You’re alone
You’re all still alive
You’re all in my eyes
You’re all I need
You’re afraid
You’re a weed
You’re a waste of time
You’re a voice
You’re a traitor
You’re a tortoise
You’re a red pill
You’re a one of them
You’re a nuisance
You’re a merry song
You’re a gung-ho gun
You’re a giant strap
You’re a dream
You’re a bruiser
You’re a beautiful girl
You’ll not be afraid
You’ll never understand
You’ll never see
You’ll never know
You’ll never get there
You’ll never find the word
You’ll never feel so nice
You’ll never catch me
You’ll need me
You’ll meet your future
You’ll make me feel good
You’ll love me
You’ll look great
You’ll live forever
You’ll like this
You’ll know no more
You’ll have it yours
You’ll have it in you
You’ll go, you and me
You’ll find me in a restaurant
You’ll find me
You’ll find another statue
You’ll die tonight
You’ll die in this world
You’ll be sorry
You’ll be okay
You’ll be my friend
You’ll be making my heart full of nails
You’ll be here someday
You’ll be alright
You’ll always be a part of my mind
Your world is just a piece of stone
Your white hair
Your wheels turn
Your voice notes
Your voice is fucking in the distance
Your vision will be violent
Your use and reproach
Your unholy drama
Your understanding is frightful
Your trash talk
Your toys don't move
Your thoughts belong within me
Your teeth could hurt
Your tears start falling
Your support
Your success
Your stomach’s on fire
Your soul won’t be long
Your soul is insensible
Your soul
Your songs turned me on
Your smile clearly set ablaze
Your skin is dying
Your skin is alive
Your sister's wrestling style
Your silhouette walks down the road
Your ship is the planet
Your shadow opens your eyes
Your sex is so messed up
Your senseless laughter
Your scarred voice
Your saint’s name
Your sad shell
Your royal heart
Your roots got buried
Your ring of thunder
Your rights look rusty
Your rages from under the tent
Your protection is indecent
Your pride turned into pride
Your pretty eyes don’t hurt
Your present moon
Your plan is only to kill a warning
Your place of honour
Your passion is growing
Your old life
Your next job
Your nerves are getting up
Your mother’s words
Your mother said my adage's up
Your mother promised me death
Your more pressing duty
Your mom will make you laugh
Your mind is so full of simple blue
Your mind is nothing else
Your medicine brings me to nowhere
Your make it shine
Your lovely little sister
Your love is eternal
Your love is calling
Your love is at last a clue
Your love for your life
Your love became human
Your lives don’t seem all that different
Your lips hurt
Your lips are never free
Your life is no longer a cakewalk
Your life is meant to be pretty
Your life is a mystery
Your life for your day
Your life could be a lie
Your legs are deceiving
Your last feeling
Your juice and nothing else
Your invincible old self
Your imagination had me
Your image as a pillow
Your house was built just the other day
Your holy name
Your high is my high
Your heart will freeze
Your heart is singing
Your heart beats in a jar
Your hatred so light
Your hard-earned cash
Your hand with him
Your hand on my heart
Your habit
Your ground floor gangsta
Your golden age
Your ghost can’t see
Your fucking own home
Your friend
Your fever sufferer’s created
Your father must be gone
Your father and his money
Your fame and your troubles
Your eyes never match
Your eyes
Your eye should have been shining
Your ears call
Your door’s got one weird one
Your dirty mind
Your dirty little sheets
Your devil for me
Your daily responsibilities
Your choice
Your broomstroke
Your broken back
Your bones belong on his shoulder
Your blue
Your blood will beat me
Your blood on my green park
Your blood hangs over the river
Your biggest mistake
Your belief in a shadow
Your acts just disappoint
Young men laughing
Young men just like me
Young crack dreams
Young chums
Young cats
Young blood's wounds are running like hail
Young and beautiful
Young Mary is half asleep
You, it’s up to you
You've got your ears wide open
You've got me there
You've brought it from hell
You're upset, we can just sit here and weep
You're mine
You're just gonna wake up next door
You're gonna hit the ground running
You're fucking my soul
You're all alone
You're a bar
You won’t walk
You won’t pay the rent
You won’t make it through
You won’t lose your soul
You won’t get nowhere
You won’t be so lonely
You won't seem the wiser
You won't give me money
You won't get through this
You will love me
You will find me
You will do whatever you like
You will do so
You will be master of my mind
You were the idol of the morning
You were prepared
You were looking down
You were growing too slow
You watched me hide in a corner
You want to be funny
You want to be free
You want me to see things
You want it right now
You want it crazy
You wanna go home?
You wanna dance naked?
You used to be happy
You used to be a wallflower
You tried so hard
You took no credit
You took it away
You took control
You told me
You talk with the dog
You take the spiritual home
You take the shine off your blue
You still want to sing
You stay the night
You stay away
You started walking right there
You seem very different
You seem surprised
You seem so new
You see?
You see you’re here
You see the fruit of my sweat
You see me now
You see it from time to time
You see how far we get
You see
You say you want it too
You say it's down to your bones
You say it with that feeling in your eyes
You say
You saw me just standing there
You said you wanted to go home
You now become bored
You never walk through that door
You never stopped sobbing
You never know
You never knew
You never get to pick your wife
You never can forget
You must win tomorrow
You must quit right now
You must belong
You must be single
You meet another human?
You mean it’s you?
You may have to keep in mind
You may as well just go find yourself
You make it hard for me
You made my soup
You made me laugh
You made it to prison
You made it through
You lost us
You look tired
You look strong
You look so sad
You look ready
You look like you’d been here before
You look like you, or you don't come close
You look around the room
You live at peace with a fool
You live alone
You like a picture
You let him stay with you
You left the army out in the open
You know, you’re good
You know you’re into it
You know you’re in for a ride
You know you’re a failure
You know why
You know who I’m gonna kill
You know when you do
You know what? I can’t be your muse
You know what you think
You know what you say
You know what you feel
You know what I'm afraid
You know what I mean?
You know what
You know that you know
You know she’d follow me home
You know my title
You know it’s hard
You know how to make my heart sing
You know how I feel
You know I’ve seen the same patterns
You know I’m getting up
You knew the same
You knew I’m coming to stop
You kept trying to kill me
You keep walking
You keep dying
You keep crying
You just can’t help it
You hold on to what you say
You hold in your hands
You heard about that
You hear the bells day and night
You have to have empathy
You have to be brave
You have things in your heart
You have no tomorrow
You have my heart
You have just done it
You have been made fun of
You have all the money
You had never done him a favour
You had it all figured out
You gotta think good of me
You gotta pick my brain
You gotta go away
You got one a minute ago
You go out in high school
You go down my broken path
You get this’s a secret
You get on better with life
You get low
You get goosebumps
You get close to heaven
You gave me a parade
You gave away everything
You found your way in
You fought through some stupid game
You forgot to pay the grandmaster
You don’t want to call your name
You don’t know what’s wrong
You don’t know me
You don’t know it’s this way
You don’t know
You don’t have to say it today
You don’t have the answer
You don’t go all summer long
You don’t do something
You don’t deserve to be around me
You don't want to go home
You don't want to go alone
You don't need me
You don't feel so good
You don't do much till today
You died pretty bad
You didn’t know
You did the right thing
You did it by force
You could teach me a lesson
You could smell those innocent things
You could have paid a fine
You could get your life together
You could be wrong
You could be mine
You come through with me
You can’t think of another name
You can’t help it’s so blank
You cannot believe it
You can't be me
You can touch me
You can touch a key
You can take it on
You can smell her hair
You can see the laws
You can see that past
You can see it now
You can probably beat me
You can live on the moon
You can have life
You can get paid more than I’m asking for
You can fix yourself
You can feel so alive
You can feel my arms around you
You can do my thing
You can decide what you want
You can call me seductive
You can believe it's happening
You call this her treasure
You belong in my store
You asked him if…
You are’re the top monster
You aren't very fat
You are wondering
You are the charm
You are so young
You are so tired
You are okay
You are my role model
You are me
You are going crazy
You are exactly where I ought to be
You are always crying
You and me in the street
You and I’ve met
You and I get together everyday
You all pushed me away
You all know
You ain’t there to hide
You ain't really home
You ain't free
Yesterday
Yes... we’ve got no success
Yes, yes, yes I’m bored
Yes, yes, please
Yes, we will
Yes, this was right around the corner
Yes, the old way
Yes, right
Yes, really quite comfortably
Yes, please don’t let me down
Yes, bring me no pain
Yes to call you so
Yes
Yellow things need you
Yellow snout
Years without fireworks
Years pass in silence
Yeah...
Yeah, what’s the point?
Yeah, we're friendly
Yeah, they call me that
Yeah, there's some key
Yeah, that had been a bit heavy
Yeah, okay
Yeah, it’s easy to be lazy
Yeah, come on for a ride
Yeah, can't be anything good
Yeah, as the morning opens
Yeah, alright
Yeah, I’ve got it called
Yeah, I know what you mean
Yeah, I guess
Yeah you go
Yeah this time
Yeah they’re gonna keep doing
Yeah so knowing I love you
Yeah okay I need to be fast
Yeah but there is no escape
Yeah I’m talking to the bells
Yeah I saw it in the flag
Wrongs of the city
Written in an iron chair
Wrangling a chorus
Wound up
Wouldn't you like a lil' light
Wouldn't you be happy?
Wouldn't it be funny if he’s loved again
Wouldn't be a mistake
Would you like to dance to it
Would you lie under the stars
Would you leave me alone
Would be out of time
Would I lie
Worn out
World and race
Working without thought
Working on a painting
Working just to hold it together
Worked like hell
Work up tonight
Woolly whale
Woolly
Won’t they please you?
Won’t lose my share
Won’t look
Won’t hold in your arms
Won’t forget
Wondering why there is no tomorrow
Wondering for life
Wonderful stage
Wonderful prison
Wonder why you’ve gotta be here
Wonder what we forgot?
Wonder the nation
Wonder
Won't that be pretty?
Won't nobody go
Won't move the shame
Won't make you happy
Won't lose her sweet face
Won't let anybody else know
Won't know what you need
Won't go away
Woke up in a furnace
Woe is me
Without us
Without thinking
Without the sun
Without searching
Without protection
Without him
Without getting into this deep silence
Without bells
Without God
Within the shadows
Within six or seven hundred yards
Within a month
With your sky
With your new-found strength
With your money
With your blood collection
With you down and with us
With wings on your legs
With wings dark and red
With white clothes
With what is left
With violence and love
With unfettered love
With time comes your own reality
With their hovels
With the soldiers and killers
With the promise of tomorrow
With the mamma's ring
With the light of day
With the jam and the laughter
With the good plan
With the drug’s punishment
With sorrows of everlasting fire
With somebody else
With some surprise
With purpose
With peace
With out the misery
With our support
With notes written down
With no voice I’m gonna go
With my mind
With my lust and my love
With my lips wide open
With most people
With luck
With low hopes
With lips that have now sold it
With it for you
With his still bleeding eye
With her shadow
With her eyes
With hearts full of blood
With everything in her mind
With every trick
With devotion’s eyes
With clear eyes
With bones to kill
With blue eyes
With another salute
With an old friend
With all the people in it
With all that I see
With all our bullets
With a smile
With a shadow of my face
With a secret heart
With a question mark
With a nickel to the dollar
With a headache
With a grin
With a gaze of pity
With a dog
With a companion in tow
With a boy
With a ball of fur
With God there
Wishing you new lives
Wishing nothing but paradise
Wishing for the sun
Wished for God
Wish me a bigger red cloak
Wish I would die
Wish I hadn't been here
Wish I could take it easy
Wiping the leaves
Wiped out in the graveyard
Wipe you dry
Wipe our records clean
Wipe me from my soul
Wipe it all out of me
Wintertime
Winds of revolution
Will your boss get up tomorrow?
Will you love me a little more?
Will you keep eating through me?
Will you join us tomorrow
Will you ever stop?
Will pass that time
Will no one spare you?
Will never feel free
Will make our moonshine
Will it kill me?
Will do anything
Will all the weeping be kept alive?
Wilder than I remembered
Wild creatures afraid
Wild and wild
Why’ve you never been the same?
Why you’re off to a great start
Why you want to dance?
Why must I?
Why isn't anyone doing it?
Why is it time to change your image?
Why if she shouldn't go
Why has it been so long since I did?
Why has it all been left to us?
Why else can't you sleep?
Why don't you pay the bill?
Why do you need me?
Why do you feel so sorry?
Why didn't you just move my arm?
Why did we lose all hope?
Why can't you sleep at home
Why can't we just stop seeing?
Why am I here?
Why I hate you
Who’s standing?
Who’s running around?
Who’s right?
Who’s really the king
Who’s impressed?
Who’s got your star?
Who’s got no fight left
Who’s doing it?
Who’s at fault here?
Who’s all you need
Who’s a giant?
Who’d you meet?
Whose love’s been lost
Whose eternal dreams
Whose baby’s to know?
Whoopee now
Who?
Who's in the box
Who wouldn’t play me?
Who will take us back?
Who wants love from their lips?
Who gets home the best?
Who doesn't believe in divine power?
Who dares to touch you?
Who cares?
Whitebird
White things
White rhinestone streets
White pearl tint
White out with the sun
White is broken
White horse head
White hand
White bubbles
White as silk
Whispering canyons
Whisper a street sobriety breath
While you were watching
While you lie awake
While you hang in there
While you can’t look away
While you are looking down
While women keep running away
While we wait
While we did sleep
While they are here
While there’s violence
While the wind blows
While the sun's shining
While the sun's not shining
While she rakes in your money
While nowhere to hide
While my flesh’s cracked
While moving across time
While in prison
While he's looking for you
While he stands and waits
While he always ran for her
While everybody else is away
While crying
While a person hangs his head
While a dinosaur bird’s head falls
While I’m flying
While I’m busy crying
While I'm still in love
While I wait for the month to come
While I lay lying there
Which is why I want you
Which door is the other side
Wherever you wanna be
Wherever you end up
Wherever you come from
Wherever you can ride
Wherever the fun's been brought
Wherever he’s lying
Wherever I go
Wherever I could be
Wherein I hide?
Where's the soup?
Where's the bathroom?
Where's my diamond?
Where's my ass?
Where your mouth sinks
Where you went wrong
Where you gonna go?
Where you belong
Where you are’re standing
Where will you go?
Where will she go?
Where we want to be
Where we live
Where we go
Where to sing
Where time is running out
Where those pictures are taken
Where they lived the rest of their lives
Where they belong
Where there is a black hole
Where there are long forgotten rooms
Where the wind is blowing
Where the trail leads to…
Where the sun shines
Where the pain is now
Where the music stops
Where the moon
Where the money was yesterday
Where the law's been broken
Where the heart really is
Where the future leads
Where the dreams were from
Where the devil is stalking you
Where the crying is
Where the country lies
Where still you come
Where she goes inside
Where our enemies will lie
Where old men came from
Where none stood
Where night is a mist
Where my brother never seen
Where might we hide
Where men like that
Where it’s night
Where it’s loud and proud
Where it gets harder
Where he said salvation comes out
Where he can kiss
Where everything goes
Where dreams come true
Where do you want to go?
Where do you want to go
Where do you go now?
Where did your name come from?
Where did you go
Where could we go?
Where are you?
Where are you when you need me?
Where all the way to hell
Where all the Christian money went
Where all of you were
Where I’m bending over backwards
Where I’d leave you
Where I stay
Where I sit from now on
Where I live
Where I go after my windup
Where I don’t wish you knew
Where I come from
Where I can hang out
When’s a girl with the right or wrong
Whenever they say I'm wrong
Whenever the night came light
Whenever I was young
Whenever I walk on shore
When you’re standing beside me
When you’re pretty
When you’re inside
When you're done
When you touch her eyes
When you see me
When you look at her
When you leave me now
When you gotta push it to the ground
When you emerge into the daylight
When you drag yourself down
When you didn’t belong
When you become satisfied
When you are all gone
When will it end?
When we’re all together
When we’ll meet again
When we went across the street
When we meet again
When we get down on our hands
When we come home
When we became poor
When this clock goes off
When they’re long gone
When they let you in
When they know you are there
When they do
When there is nothing I can do
When there are no restrictions
When the world dies
When the sun shines
When the sun glowed
When the rope fell apart
When the enemy comes on the attack
When the butterfly sat down
When the breasts’re gone
When someone else brings you money
When should we go?
When she smiles
When she looked at me with blank eyes
When our hands touch
When others cry
When my smiling eyes meet my shadow
When little ones always want him
When it’s warm in the sun
When it’s too late
When it rains
When it comes to boobs
When it comes time for me
When it comes out
When it comes down to what I know
When it ain't white
When he pulls through
When he comes home
When fate kills
When ever that moment comes true
When didn’t you hear?
When did you reach so high?
When did you get down here?
When anyone’s coming over
When all comes crashing down
When I’m like this
When I’m doing it right
When I’m around
When I’m a woman
When I was gonna cry
When I tried to reach them
When I stop talking
When I say that first time
When I say goodbye
When I say I was pleased
When I sat
When I ran away from them
When I met you
When I last saw you
When I finally got tired
When I finally got one
When I could live
What’s wrong
What’s going to happen now?
What’s all those paintings out there?
Whatever you have received
What?
What's your boss supposed to say?
What's wrong with her?
What's the reason?
What's the meaning?
What's next?
What you’ve seen
What you’ve got left
What you’ve been waiting for
What you’re doing
What you would like to know?
What you spent your time doing
What you look like in a photograph
What you expect
What you dream
What you don’t know
What you did to me
What would you do?
What will you say?
What will you do?
What will be done
What will I do to your affection ?
What we have been waiting for
What we had stood for
What we do
What was the pain?
What took you so long?
What they say
What the hell do you mean?
What the hell am I doing here?
What she called my portrait
What really matters is today
What now?
What men can do
What matters here
What makes my nights different
What made you think I could escape?
What life’s all about
What kind of sales do you know?
What isn't to fear?
What is wrong with me
What is this place called?
What is the big deal?
What is the beauty of yours?
What is it really?
What is a trick
What if you don't want to go?
What if it’s broken down and torn apart?
What he will do
What feeling like contact means
What ends up in your eyes
What else will he do
What else do you suppose?
What do you want?
What do you think?
What do you mean by it?
What do you call me?
What do we say tomorrow?
What do we mean by saying we don't care?
What do we do now
What do I know’s happening
What do I get paid to do?
What did you tell me?
What did I say?
What color flowers sing
What can I say?
What began as a thousand hearts
What are you’re saying to yourself
What are you doing today?
What are you afraid to say?
What are we doing now?
What an incredible part
What an almost noble goal
What am I to know
What about you
What about me?
What a time to be alive
What a pit of beasts
What a lie
What a blessed day
What I was good at
What I used to love
What I once thought to be a beautiful art
What I need
What I know
What I cannot help you
What I can do
We’ve got to pass on
We’ve got nothing to hide
We’ve been the best
We’ve all taken my fingers
We’ve all been scared
We’re young and want to fly
We’re torn apart
We’re outside
We’re looking for it
We’re like pirates
We’re just waiting for you
We’re doing it right
We’re both dead
We’re all turned upside down
We’re all stuck together
We’re all lying
We’re all insane
We’re all in love
We’re all friends
We’ll see you soon
We’ll ride
We’ll not be so old
We’ll meet tomorrow
We’ll get you wet
We’ll be moving in different directions
We’ll be crying
We’ll all cry
Wet, sweaty things
Wet o' dust
Wet moving mirror
Wet dream day
Weren't we yesterday?
Weren't they very kind?
Well, you’re so late
Well, you’re a businessman
Well, you must be forgetting
Well, we're gonna get out
Well, that has gone too far
Well, John Toques
Well, I don’t mind
Well that will be fair
Well one night in the grindhouse
Well my pity
Well let me just say
Well it depends on where you're at
Well here comes the good news
Well hello, you’re looking down
Well done today
Well done
Well I’m worried
Well I know where you’re parked
Welcome to the crazy lands
Welcome to the crazy land
Welcome to paradise
Weaving stream of sound
Wearing no shoes
Wear your soul
Wear it all over your clothes
We've lost a God
We've left here
We've heard his name in the room
We've got our sympathy
We've got a deal
We've been living within ourselves
We've been friends
We're not yet inside
We're no longer dead
We're just fucking away
We're gonna get there
We're all heading up for one day
We'll take care of each other
We'll find him
We'll do it together
We won't give him away
We won't be together
We won't be rid of you
We will ride it out
We will probably meet again
We will never meet
We will make them go away
We will face each other
We will eat together
We wanted the music
We wanna shoot the shit from below
We walk through a dream
We used to be kindred spirits
We turn down his cow
We took you out of it
We stay here forever
We start again
We stand together
We sold ourselves
We sold all our hearts
We shouldn't pay attention to you
We should leave a trail
We should go
We should forget him
We should come together
We share our thoughts
We shall see you every morning
We shall bring our own children
We see the same concept
We saw it all
We saw him crying
We saved that woman
We really fucked up
We reach the middle of nowhere
We reach across and around you
We pay for his milk
We pass down the music
We parted like a wave
We ought to be together
We never knew what we were
We need you more
We need to stop pretending
We need to hear you
We need to get home
We need someone to look after us
We must stay together
We move past that unspoken tension
We might let the shard go
We made promises
We made money
We look back at you
We lived in the moment
We live in a picture
We live in a nice place
We landed safely
We laid flowers
We know you’re dead
We know something’s wrong
We know it’s a good game
We killed ourselves
We just sold out
We just met
We just gotta get to our friends
We just burst with laughter
We hear you’re blowing a match
We have never met
We have known each other for years
We have good eyes
We had to be beside ourselves
We had seen my sides
We had no control
We had lost control
We had friends dead for generations
We had a shadow
We had a beer when it came time
We grew apart
We got some bad news
We got people
We go, go
We go on sailing boards
We gave up when you told us the news
We gave everything away
We found the same news
We flew across the sky
We feel good
We each must pay attention
We don’t talk much
We don’t see it’s long ago
We don’t belong here
We don't love you
We don't know why
We die singing in his breast
We didn't do anything to us
We did it together
We did it differently
We danced a little differently
We created him
We could find a way
We could die alone
We come so late
We come from the east
We care not who dies
We can. Like putting my mind on it
We can't ride you away
We can't go nowhere
We can walk down the street
We can sing
We can only dream
We can go in this way
We can call you saint
We call you our lovers
We broke with that law
We both share
We are yours
We are the river
We are still at the bridge
We are so scared
We are running out
We are parted lips
We are part of another rainbow
We are nothing but dead old people
We are my own creation
We are like a fake
We are in the line of attack
We are his own rules
We are gone
We are going to need you
We are all together
We are a gang of deceit
We always lived at sea
We always knew he was gonna die
We almost forgot...
We all started talking
We all met at the zoo
We all have our minds on us
We all die
We all came down blind
We
Way up here
Way to understand
Way down on the dragoon
Way down here—there’s a hole in the heart
Waving down a tree
Waves shimmer around
Waves back down again
Waterfalls
Water to his heart
Water in the sky
Water falls
Water and mist
Watching you struggle with booze
Watching you shower
Watching you burn
Watching us fall
Watching themselves fade
Watching their wings burn
Watching the sun set
Watching the sun rise
Watching the silver tongue
Watching the same old movie
Watching the love seed snake
Watching the future
Watching starfish crawl
Watching people die
Watching my mother die
Watching music
Watching in the distance
Watching his face
Watching his eyes come and go
Watching him tremble
Watching her fall
Watching for me
Watching birds from cloud tops
Watching TV
Watcher of life
Watched you smile
Watch your heart skip a beat
Watch the sun shine
Watch out on the lonesome corridors
Watch my heart turn
Watch my face
Watch me singing
Watch me from behind
Watch how you roll my memory
Watch his hand on my shoulder
Watch as the summertime brightens
Watch as a weapon
Wasn't right here
Wash the ship
Wash it away
Wash away the ashes
Was that your king?
Was it supposed to be about your lives?
Was born just to be alone
Warning
Warmaster, warlord
Warm stuff to change
Warm memories
War to slow down
War on the wall
War asks me to surrender
Wanting to play
Wanted to give someone
Wanted it all for the third time
Want to stop and sit?
Want to play the rules?
Want to know, how you got where?
Want to be the master of my destiny
Want the words
Want me on all this?
Want me naked
Walls too high
Walls thin and proud
Walls across time
Wall of death
Wall of a bottle
Wall by wall
Walking with my hands
Walking to the sun
Walking through town
Walking through life
Walking the streets
Walking out onto your town
Walking out from your slumber
Walking on water
Walking like a lost soul
Walking in the night
Walking in the black
Walking in on my victim
Walking in free will
Walking from a volcano
Walking down the street
Walking down the dark path
Walking behind the curtain
Walking away
Walking as fuck
Walking around on the street
Walking around like the darkness
Walking around inside me
Walking across the stage
Walking across the road
Walked past eyes
Walk your life away
Walk with me
Walk our corridors
Walk in the stars
Walk down to a soulless corner
Walk down the street
Walk by my window
Walk around trying to cheat
Walk around
Waking up to a vision
Waking up in the middle of the night
Waking up drunk
Waking up as a tired dog
Waking up
Waking in their quiet
Wake up your mouth
Wake up tomorrow morning
Wake up now
Wake me up at home
Wake me up
Wake in the middle of the night
Waiting to wake
Waiting to meet you
Waiting to catch up
Waiting to be taunted
Waiting for your song
Waiting for your master
Waiting for your hollow
Waiting for you to pass
Waiting for you to find it
Waiting for you to die
Waiting for you to come
Waiting for you to be satisfied
Waiting for tomorrow
Waiting for them
Waiting for the world to turn
Waiting for the truth
Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sky to warm
Waiting for the sea
Waiting for the rain
Waiting for the perfect day
Waiting for something
Waiting for one of these worlds
Waiting for night
Waiting for another dream
Waiting for a sign
Waiting for a scream
Waiting for a kick in the ears
Waiting for a burst
Waiting for a boy
Wait for the rest of the world
Wait for the new day
V’s still alive
Vows to tear you apart
Voting for oil
Voting for Colgate
Vomiting white and red
Vomit me
Voices you can hear
Voices within me
Voices to entertain
Visions that will change forever
Visions of the sea
Visions of ruin
Visions of painting
Visions of my own death
Visions of mankind
Visions of his fingers
Visions of broken hearts
Visions dancing in the wind
Visions and memory
Visions
Violent act
Violence, hate, violence
Very well
Very violent
Very tired
Very tender
Very strange blue
Very soon will we let the stars start to fade
Very scary
Very nice example
Very interesting story
Very funny
Very fine
Verbal violence
Vanquish the cold
Vanishing my mind
Vanishing in my vision
Vanished from you
Vanished
Vain to lose
V-Day of consent
Utter word of the Crown
Using your mercy
Using them as a commercial asset
Using as a weapon
Used your false soap
Used up the patience
Used her fingers
Used a spoon
Upstairs
Upon the craggy line
Upending the romance
Upcoming justice
Up to their bank
Up to that number
Up to now
Up the route
Up right then and up there
Up on the freedom top of the star
Up in the sky
Up in hell
Up here
Up for anything
Up comes the rose
Up close and personal
Up and out
Up and down in a million ways
Up and down
Up above the cloud
Unwrap the fire
Until you throw my arse at me
Until you are ready
Until tomorrow
Until they show up
Until the beast dies
Until now
Until no one wants it
Until my face is clear
Until last time
Until her grandpa found her
Until he ends up with me
Until I lose my mind
Until I can do something
Unsparing for you
Unsold secrets
Unlike life
Unknown
Uninvited from sight
Uninvited
Unfolding the leads
Unfailing
Undertale
Understood
Understanding everything
Underserved visions
Underneath your heat
Underneath your despair
Underneath this haze
Underneath the sky
Underneath the heavy rain
Underneath the creeper boats
Underneath my hair
Underneath his yawn
Underneath every shattered lock
Under this curse
Under the tree
Under the stage
Under the skin
Under the shadows
Under the shadow
Under the saddle
Under the half moon
Under my mattress
Under an absent night
Under God's authority
Unconstitutionally rude to others
Uncharacteristic success
Unbreakable dreams
Unapologetically helpful
Ummmmm, how can I sit on my hands?
Ugly look
Uggshells
Two sides of the same coin
Two rings
Two little sad horses
Two laws
Two holes of sliver
Two good times we could have known
Two footprints
Two colours
Two children keeping their faces up
Two bright years
Two blows out
Two big worries
Two bars
Twentyfour patches of paint
Twenty-five minutes on the clock
Twelve years I've walked the streets
Twelve rap songs this time
Twelve miles down the highway
Turning the weight of my concerns
Turning our back on you
Turning off your game
Turning me down
Turning it on
Turning into my body
Turning down from a mission
Turning clear and tidy
Turning blue
Turned to steam
Turned out to be great
Turned out like this
Turned me round
Turned into a drain
Turned down yesterday
Turned down the street
Turn your song around
Turn your arms around me
Turn the rainbows down
Turn on the display
Turn my career around
Turn me back
Turn it off from dawn
Turn inside out
Turn down my music
Turn around in my mind
Turn around and take it back
Turn around
Turn and run
Tune your windows
Tune in how you feel
Tune in for a run
Tune in every goddamn hour
Trying to win by splitting pixels
Trying to waltz out
Trying to seduce him
Trying to salvage something
Trying to ruin his glory
Trying to make the happy ones
Trying to make sense
Trying to lie
Trying to get it to leave me alone
Trying to get away
Trying to catch a flight
Trying to bounce
Trying to befriend new people
Trying to be popular
Trying hard to survive
Try to see him a while in the haze
Try to make it’s nice
Try to keep me warm
Try to hear your frustration
Try to come back
Try to change your mind
Try this together
Try not to wake up someone
Try getting away
Try and let the nightmare end
Try
Trust
True truth
True life and an hourglass vision
True in Hollywood
True doge
True and a ghost
True God
Tried to relate
Tried to make you look comfortable
Tried to catch you
Tried to be trash
Treasure in a glass jar
Treasure and the magic
Travel a thousand miles
Travel
Trapping together
Trapped, dead, trapped
Trapped in that silent place
Trapped in a prison cell
Trapped in a fire
Trapped and stuck
Trans fats get wasted
Toy and the treasure I am
Touching you like some emotion
Touch your skin
Touch of eternal peace
Touch my breasts
Touch my bed with her fingers
Touch me, please
Touch me with that lousy guitar
Touch me when you cry
Touch me
Totally out in the open
Totally ornery
Totally never gonna look the same
Totally home in his mind
Totally gonna sell you
Totally cool
Top of the mountain
Took you to supper
Took you to hell
Took you by your hand
Took you by surprise
Took the girl away
Took no break
Took my sister there
Took my picture
Took my eyes off of me
Took it too far
Took her outside with me
Took her for a ride
Took everything from you
Took care of me
Took advantage
Too weird to say goodbye
Too tired to have begun
Too tired to feel
Too strong for you
Too slow, too slow
Too slow to call out your name
Too much to do
Too much time is spent
Too much money
Too much honey
Too much and too little
Too many people
Too low for fame
Too late to say goodbye
Too heavy
Too good to be true
Too fucking complicated
Too fucking bitter
Too fucked up for you
Too early
Too deep for your head
Too cold to be a lover
Too busy thinking
Tonight I love
Tonight
Tomorrow’s getting better
Tomorrow ’s the party time
Tomorrow would be fine
Tomorrow will be changing
Tomorrow we wake
Tomorrow may be a nightmare
Tomorrow is mine
Tomorrow
Told you so, fucking shame
Told you she was dead
Told to share
Told me to hide my face
Told me everything
Told in our bones
Today you can ride the dark forces
Today it was dark
Today I’ve had that fear
Today I know what you’re feeling
Today
To you and me
To win up all that you missed
To where they go wrong
To what you had to say
To watch money fly
To wake a broken heart
To use your enthusiasm for me
To turn through your infinite nights
To turn me away
To turn into a petrified animal
To try and hang ourselves
To touch you and your dark sides
To touch ourselves
To touch every corner
To think of you
To the west
To the tune of Tom Baker records
To the town I grew up in
To the moon
To the least
To the land of the wild
To the eyes of his own people
To the extreme
To the dusty cemetery
To tempt you
To tease a little kid
To take you apart
To take a leap
To take a knife edge
To support the dreams
To stay the same
To stay alive
To speak truthfully
To spark your skill
To spare my son
To sow sorrows
To some leitmotif
To sleep safely
To sit with a statue
To sit and watch her life change
To sit alone in our honeymoon
To share that love
To share my defeat with you
To serve the devil
To see you
To see what’s around you
To see the world in a lather
To see the diamonds cut off my hair
To see his shit right now
To search for my body
To say the wildest thing to someone
To run so fast
To ride it in one
To reveal his love
To relieve herself
To reach the great father
To reach the end of the road
To push your head to the ground
To pull it up
To prove you wrong
To prove you men
To prepare myself
To play games of dying
To pierce all walls
To pass my mind
To paint your father
To paint down a statue
To pack you in
To order somebody else
To need a bit more
To my fourth year
To move there
To me you sound so old
To me
To make you want to lose your peace
To make you use this power
To make thee tremble
To make myself stronger
To make me look good
To make it out alive
To make her hangover
To make a game you were right
To live with kings
To live in ruins
To listen to you
To linger here for another generation
To leave you running
To know you're my friend
To know my innermost thoughts
To keep my memory away
To hide yourself
To hide the truth
To her ecstasy
To have your hand
To guide you
To grow up so young
To grow up
To go on the rampage
To go for the perfect match
To give you a look
To give a shadow
To give a hand to Queen’s soup
To get you through
To get up
To get rid of your faults
To get close
To get away from our parents
To free myself
To find you
To find true love
To find things of value
To find something wrong
To find out where he came from
To find out what you mean
To find out how I can trust the world
To find myself empty
To fight the dragon
To face the evil of the act
To drag yourself away
To destroy you
To defend the holy plant
To cry the song
To cry out
To crawl all over the border
To cower so that the wind can blow
To come to you
To come to me
To claim the world
To burn by me
To burn and drown
To bring you together
To bring love
To break the silence
To break free
To be sad and angry
To be quiet
To be lazy
To be in love
To be free
To be cool with the beginning
To be buried with your tail behind
To be an angel
To be alone in the sun
To be a cliche
To bare the hardest battle
To ask him the question
To argue
To another world
To almost smile
To a devil
To a certain extent
To Tender the sweet couch
Tired of the others
Tired of stealing love
Tired of me seeing you
Tired of keeping the innocent silent
Tired of it all
Tired of going without you
Tired of getting down
Tired of feeding myself
Tired of being a son
Time won't run out
Time to take on ourselves
Time to start anew
Time to smile
Time to sing
Time to grow stronger
Time to grind
Time to go the way you are
Time to go
Time to dance
Time to commit suicide
Time to climb up the bunk
Time to be good
Time slips away
Time passes and the sun shines
Time passes
Time passed
Time no longer the worst
Time is running out
Time is on your side
Time is at a standstill
Time here I thought
Time has run out
Time gives me hope
Time for the sun
Time for the day
Time for a question
Time can turn purple
Time burns like water
Time away, Romeo and Juliet
Time away
Till you’re awake
Till you surrender
Till you shake
Till you die
Till you be called
Till tomorrow it must grow
Till the soul of his dreams starts to shake
Till now
Till I’m dead
Till I get myself back
Till I end
Till I die
Thunderstruck
Throwing wreaths
Throwing the turkey carcass
Throwing stuff away
Throwing me into a mirror
Throwing his hands up
Throwing balls at you
Throwing away my word
Throwing away his work
Throwing away excuses
Throwing a call in the wind
Throw yourself apart
Throw your love away
Throw their hats in the ring
Throw the wind in your face
Throw the false grin
Throw sand out of her eyes
Throw me into all kinds of patterns
Throw me all over yourself
Throw it in the trash
Throw him around like a trophy
Throw away the secrets
Throw a ball down
Throughneath
Through your dreams
Through the window
Through the wild world
Through the walls
Through the teeth of my own band
Through the stars
Through the smoke from the fire
Through the show of time
Through the sand
Through the ruins
Through the mouth
Through the haze
Through the gutters
Through the gate
Through the emptiness
Through the dryer
Through the crying sun
Through the cracks
Through the crack of a feather
Through the cemetery
Through some people
Through our wild angles
Through my soul
Through my parents
Through her nose
Through her mind
Through and through
Through a window
Through a vein
Through a goddamned window
Through a gap
Through a clear glass
Thrice your wealth
Thoughts, no matter what
Thoughts for some reason
Thoughts could be pretty
Thoughts and chases
Thought to be a world apart
Thought he had seen
Thought all of this will be fine
Though time might have turned
Though that all comes crashing down
Though darker than I am
Though I looked more alive
Those who lie
Those two words
Those three towers
Those inside your head
Those flowers that used to lie on the ground
Those first snowflakes
Those feet are burned
Those assholes only get stupid
This won't have to be bad
This will crush you
This way’s all pretty
This town might be free
This town in the sky
This town called you
This town
This tired show
This time today
This time I will follow’s way
This thread ran out of an hour
This thing we call beauty
This the last time
This table
This sound it made
This should be with you
This record is such a charm
This place is not what it used to be
This old art: You’re always so interesting
This new flag
This movie looks for this peace
This moment comes to us
This little square
This language
This land is yours
This isn't work
This is your world
This is your pride
This is why I was afraid
This is where you belong
This is what you look for
This is the sunshine
This is the real world
This is the new music
This is the future
This is the damn place
This is the coolest movie I've ever seen
This is right before your eyes
This is my secret so deep
This is my me
This is my little world
This is love in a glass coffin
This is her life
This is going to be him
This is destiny
This is all I have, play with me
This is all I have to say
This is a spiritual grieve
This is a meaningless dream
This is a good time
This is a fickle thing
This is a day for dialogue
This in the grass
This human condition
This heavenly god
This hatred is contagious
This has nothing to do with crying baby
This hand’s open
This girl’s from Maine
This game - meaning so much to me
This game
This funeral is just before me
This full stop
This feels like a storm
This feels a bit like big light
This city will be in ruin
This child lives up to her name
This cauldron full of secrets
This can't be ignored
This call from heaven
This baby
This ancient cannibal killer
This alone
Third window
Third time around
Third down on the scale
Thinking-glass
Thinking of everything
Thinking about you
Think you already know
Think of what you’ve been through
Think of my body
Think of another
Think nothing of life
Think it’s wrong
Think it all worth it
Think inside the mind
Think and think again
Think a little more
Think
Things you think
Things you see and hear everyday
Things you didn’t know
Things you can say
Things will be better and worse
Things we talked about in my youth
Things we knew
Things we could do
Things to do
Things that never change
Things that may or may not survive
Things that make me laugh
Things that do don't matter
Things that didn't belong
Things that I don’t mind
Things take a back seat
Things start to piss you off
Things seem to slip away
Things seem fine
Things I thought of no one else
Things I missed
Things I love about her
Things I cannot see
They’ve watched you bleed
They’ve got the time to get locked in
They’ve got no pulse
They’ve got faces against mirrors
They’re probably watching
They’re all wrong
They're supposed to be like an ordinary day
They're all together
They'll tear us apart
They worked harder for you
They won’t look down
They won't pay
They will be happy
They were never gentle
They were my friends
They wave
They understand
They took my life, they took my money
They thought so
They teach how to play
They talked past each other
They take pleasure
They sure never knew
They started a chain reaction
They should at least give me the money
They seem indecipherable
They see me
They say, watch out for me
They say he’s my friend
They saw you’d sit there
They need you
They must've gone really high
They mumble more than it’s worth
They made love
They looked at you with cold hatred
They know you’re looking through your lens
They hate you
They had no morals
They got right under your nose
They get tired of me
They gave up on their low hopes
They fought for what they had
They didn’t reveal their secrets
They danced outside
They could be dangerous
They come through what’s possible
They brought your food
They began the sad days
They ain't made this perfect
These trials and tribulations
These trails to meet
These strange tears
These songs give my generation space
These questions have no answers
These past days
These pants do not fit
These haute bourgeois days
These dreams
These dogs bark
These dead ends
These days I can’t find you
These assassins hate me
These are your dreams
These are times I want
These are love letters
There’s nothing to make of it
There’s nothing like she
There’s no one to watch
There's no time to waste
There's no room for you
There's lots of other people
There were no waste of their money
There were horns on a stick
There was one gentle light
There was me and you
There isn't time to sit down
There is no doubt I don't get higher
There is no avoiding this place
There are times I thought I was gone
There are some minutes until tomorrow
There are no newsmen
There are my pictures
There are forgotten skeletons
There are dangers inside
There ain't much to lose
Then you’re free
Then you sit next to me
Then why wait?
Then what do you think
Then we both hear
Then turn away, alright?
Then there's nothing anymore
Then there was pain
Then somehow I’ll find it
Then she’s dead
Then she opens the box and it’s busy
Then she had found me
Then sell his soul
Then go on your merry way
Then don’t try harder
Then again, they are far apart
Then a bowl of soup
Then I was young again
Then I look in the mirror
Then I knew
Their wives talked
Their nuts and bolts
Their haircut suit
Their dreams never end
The world’s a mad place
The world's way
The world of music
The world of hoeing
The world is turned upside down
The world is melting
The world gets buried
The words die hard
The word wins
The wooden shack
The womb of a gentleman
The wildsman
The widow
The whole world's gonna dance
The whole train wreck
The whole place is quiet
The wetter shore
The wet dream
The wedding ring
The way you talk
The way you look at it
The way you feel
The way you dress
The way you come
The way we know
The way we belong
The way to soul
The way to love
The way to check somebody's dream
The way she talked
The way I see it
The way
The waves sound like steel
The waters of love
The waters call
The water here, the bones under the paint
The watchman
The warm season
The walls shut
The walls of your head
The voices of the souls
The voices have been silenced
The voices
The voice on the soundtrack
The voice leads me to leave
The voice in your head
The vision
The violence that remains
The urge against kings
The up and coming tickets
The unknown
The two ways
The truth’s true
The truth’s all broken
The truth of life
The truth comes
The truth before all the lawsuits
The truth
The true, a shadowlike thing
The true machine
The trees are falling
The tree of the free state
The tornado flashes
The times she came
The time has come to send
The time had come
The time flies
The tide is round
The thunderstorm
The thrill of moving across the water
The thrill of falling away
The things I try to make
The thing with the bells
The thin line
The theme of the show
The tentacle shakes
The tension keeps running through my veins
The tears flowed
The tearful wheel
The taste of sulfur
The taste of flame
The sweat remains
The swamp fills the night
The sunset
The sunrises
The sunlight fades away
The sunken tomb
The sun will set at nine am
The sun was shining
The sun smiles
The sun rest in my eyes
The sun reflected
The sun of some greatness
The sun kissed the blue
The sun in my eyes
The sun has risen
The sun can be yours
The sun breaks in awe
The sun at the shore
The sun
The suffocating soul
The streets weeps
The streetlife ghost of fame
The streams started to drain of colour
The streams of something lonely
The stone bone jaw
The statue wall
The static of your paradise
The stars shout
The stars shake
The stars dance
The stars are shining
The stars are seen higher
The star on the staircase
The star is set
The star
The square me
The spiritual postulate
The speed with which time keeps repeating
The speed of our dreams
The sparks go from inside your heart
The sparkles of affection
The sounds of morning intermission
The sound of these endless train wrecks
The sound of footsteps
The song is not the song
The snow moving
The smoke and the fire
The smell of hypocrisy
The smell of bad habits
The sleep of the subway
The sky will cover
The sky was not shaded
The sky looked tender
The sky is my deck
The sky is falling
The sky is empty
The sky does not care
The singing of a dying star
The simple way
The silver lining
The silhouette of something good
The sight that comes around the bend
The shuffling shadows
The shots the rays-screens shot me
The shoes you’ll be wearing
The ship will sink on April solstice
The ship that sent you
The shadows remain
The shadow of rose
The shadow of love
The sewer dream
The servants looked away
The sentiment has kept me going
The seeds are planted
The secret sauce
The sea’s turned cloudy
The season is on
The search for sleep
The seams were drawn together
The seagull
The screen of death
The scientific wiles
The same way to trade down
The same broken promises
The salvation in ashes
The saints will sing at the floor
The safe zone
The safe place
The saddest day
The sad life you come out of
The running star
The rumor for eternity
The rule of law
The rope was loose
The roots in the sand
The romance for you
The romance
The roads are narrow
The road has wide open
The river whirls around me
The river and the sun
The rise of the tidal wave
The rings out
The ring road
The rich kid
The rich and famous
The resistance slowly opens in
The reminders don't ring
The reason you're not here
The reason I’m here
The reason I said sorry
The reason I fell
The reason I exist
The rays of love
The rap music in my head
The rainbow burst
The rain stops
The rain falls
The quiet that fills my body
The quick time and once again
The quality made him weary
The pussy of guilt
The purists call me an evil lust fiend
The pure, mindless zeta ray
The prize’s fine
The prison's broken and growing
The priest looks cool
The price of fame
The pretty way
The prettiest life you've ever seen
The prelude
The power, the control you get
The power you gave
The power of the devil
The pool hallowed evening
The poison starts here
The poet could hate me
The plan is to lose her
The pitiful smith
The pipe dream
The pig here
The picture is broken
The photo kill
The people still call you names
The people like food
The people and voices of presidents
The pearls of a glade
The peace that remains inside
The past tense
The passing riot cop
The palms down
The pale army armor
The pain is over
The page of paper
The other side
The other day
The open night walkaway
The only way out
The only way
The only time I feel like you
The only thing to know
The only thing higher than winning
The only sensible person’s opinion
The only reason I'm awake
The only place I knew
The only other thing I can do
The only ones who like to talk
The only ones to die
The only man outside
The only human I know
The only game in town
The ones who watch
The one-eyed thing
The one with no candle burning
The one who knew right?
The one that started it all
The old ways
The old superstition
The old man’s side of the story
The old fountain
The obvious truth
The number of dinosaurs on an island
The noise made me sick
The noise fades away
The nightmarish mind
The nightmare has dragged on
The night is dark
The news you've got locked down
The new shreds
The new seven stars
The nest of despair
The need for a righteous dream
The name this city isn't called
The name and the date
The mysterious power
The music of the sea
The muse’s sun
The movie I came across
The mountain art
The morning star
The moons in your eyes
The moonbeam blade on the brown citadel
The moon of truth
The moon leads me to sleep
The moon is black
The moon in your eyes
The moon flutters
The moon
The monster broke the peace
The money will be paid
The money is with you
The moment is here
The moment is coming
The mirrors and the flowers
The mirror screens
The miracle of liberty
The mind is beside you
The milk of a ship
The midnight softness
The midnight show
The midnight love
The message of love
The memory is like a cylinder
The mayor
The marksmen on bones
The mark of decay
The man with no name
The man that haunts me
The machines won’t seem so complicated
The lyrics to all the things I had to say
The love-maker
The love you once shared
The love you do
The love of the flesh
The love of singing
The lost road
The lonesome night
The lonely emptiness
The lone word
The living room
The little island pirates
The liquor is drinking
The line is strong
The line fell in love
The limelight
The lights up
The lights are flashing
The light is falling
The life of living expression
The lie
The legendary lion
The left lips are hard
The last they’ve seen
The last question
The last place to hide
The last line
The last curtain
The language of your skin
The ladykillers of chaos
The lace, balls, crackers
The kiss feels good
The king’s wife
The king’s trees
The king of anything
The kindness of man
The key to time
The junkie bum
The jazz mood
The inspiration made him lose it
The information you fed up
The image that you have to be
The illusionism of love
The horse's gonna die
The hopeless sorrow
The holy synagogue of the old testament
The hollow door
The highest worth leaving behind
The help one needs
The heart of my soul
The heart of life
The health and the mind
The headless skeleton
The head of a cow
The haunted halls
The hatred you’re so afraid
The hate’s starting to show
The guy goes down with you
The gutter
The guts come out of his mouth
The guards say no
The guards are still looking
The guard is dead
The ground you laid down
The groans
The green glows
The green earth
The grass seed
The grass might be turning
The grass is blue
The grass grow red
The grass colour’s dry
The gorgeous Irish girls
The good memories of wounded men
The good feelings of my side
The golden test
The golden earth
The god who created us
The god of tomorrow
The glow of his appearance
The girl that saw some shit
The girl I wanted to be
The ghosts in the sky
The game is over
The future turned darker
The future from around here
The future
The fury of a mosquito
The fuel inside
The fucking highway's longer
The fucking country will walk
The frog art book
The freedom
The fourth god
The fountain and one-starlight
The forest of fountains
The forces of evil
The force of truth
The force of human beings
The force comes in waves
The footsteps are wide
The fly of history
The flowers with winged wings
The flowers next to the key
The flowers coming down
The floor has fallen
The flight of a frog
The first kiss is a memory
The finest ships
The final boss
The filthy double
The fifth time around
The felling whale
The feelings I went through
The fan
The fame pleases us
The false, polluted water
The faithful get away
The fading thunder
The fabled hero
The eyes of iron fools
The expectations that you had
The evils we fear
The everyman
The essence of our life
The envy of each and every other
The enemy walks now
The end times
The end of the world
The end game
The emptiness inside me
The emptiness fades away
The emptiness
The dust is falling
The dust in the air
The dry muscle
The drummer can hardly get
The dreams of Alice
The dreams in the dead silence
The dreamless master of things
The dream you hold
The dream you dream about
The dream is my own
The dream is eternal
The dream
The dragon will soon descend
The door opens in the late summer
The dog now tramples
The distance is never free
The devil will take my dead lips
The devil wants you
The destruction that is laid within
The despair in your arms
The desert's boring
The desert country
The demons never lose to you
The deeds of his children
The deck does not help
The decay
The dead, the living, the hollow
The dead priest
The day she can't quit
The day of your death
The day is over
The dawning legends
The dawn of rationality
The darkest shadows
The dark doors open
The dancing cliché
The cutlass end that poured
The curtain calls
The curse of the soul
The curse
The crime scene
The craziest car or windmill
The corrupt think I did
The corpse becomes new
The concept of a university
The common enemy
The colorful shadow
The coldest day
The cold is your hard fact
The cold comes now
The clouds of the dawn
The clouds now cover me
The cloud cut shadows
The closest you get
The class that is in charge
The city up and down
The city tomorrow
The city is built around
The charm of spring
The charm of dreams
The change that has already been felt
The chain of command
The centreline
The center of the house
The casket and the veil
The caretaker of what was
The card I don’t have
The caped crusader
The candle will burn
The camel lumps my coat
The call's out
The cake
The cage-eating bear
The bus comes to go
The broken laws
The breeze breaks
The brainchild of my sins
The boy love
The bottles fall off
The books came flying
The body around me
The blue sky
The blue park
The blood of King Ludwig
The blindman picture
The bleak hole
The blackest corridors
The black space
The bitter sting of defeat
The big picture
The best way to go home
The best things
The bells ring
The bell rings
The beauty or the curse
The beast and his language
The beaming moon
The battle between you
The basement seems cold
The bargain is overtaken
The band
The bad boy
The baby is dying
The attack became human history
The art of the chase
The armies of yours
The arboreal cat
The appeal of art
The angry pirate stares
The angels say the world is never to end
The angel of light
The anarchy
The amazing tale of music
The alarm of yellow
The air never goes off
The air cannot find its way into you
The age in the sky
The adrenaline rush
The action is good, that you can breathe
The acrid nest of godless shadows
The absence
The White House salute
The Spirit’s giving way
The Satan worship begins
The Pitiless War
The Lord is watching
The Lion, the Hare, the Bumblebee
The King of the south
The English Bird
The Bible
The American in the wake of dying
That’s why
That’s where I am
That’s what you'd be
That’s what life is all about
That’s not our fault
That’s all she got
That's why we all die
That's why I came across you
That's where I’m going
That's what you see
That's what my mother is
That's what dreams are made of
That's the way it should be
That's the truth
That's part of the world
That's not good for you
That's not fair
That's my kingdom
That's my house
That's it’s really there
That's it’s okay
That's how dangerous I get
That's gotta be a mistake
That's all I was gonna say
That's a line to all my friends
That you’ll know soon
That you know
That you came into sight of none
That you abandoned
That year the masters of archery were back
That won't work
That won't happen soon
That will never do
That will be obvious
That will be me all the time
That were two ways to meet
That way ain't all I got
That was true
That was my weak spot
That was a good time
That took a while to get over
That to you
That terror of his father
That sunken prison
That song you'd last love to sing
That sometime ago
That smile’s what you pay us to do
That smile’s in your eyes
That should be all on you
That shit taste like acid
That ship walked through the moon
That she’d found
That set the stage
That same spirit
That said, your spirit
That sad you
That other day
That nobody left to buy
That night feels still
That night
That new hope
That new collar
That never is too soon
That never happens
That my time isn't on the run
That movie was much too old to see
That movie
That means nothing to you
That may be the end
That made my life easier
That made me bleed
That low wind brings you so much stress
That leaves the other side alight
That leads me to the part
That lead
That keeps me alive
That it’s a matter of time
That it is true
That is what they thought
That is what life’s all about
That is now nearly to come
That immortal soul
That immortal song
That ill fated for them
That hurts right now
That holy summer night
That he would die
That he was lonely
That gets across the finish line
That game's been on forever
That game
That floor
That fire in the sun
That feels like a lifetime
That famous shine
That falls apart
That doesn’t matter now
That doesn't sound too good
That deep inside you’ve got lots of trouble
That day was unreal
That day at the bridge
That dark place
That damn devil
That crime is holy
That crazy memory
That card will come out on top
That bum whistles
That brother
That bright sun of love
That blew my mind
That being so sure
That as she sees it
That appears like a lie
That and the freedom
That I'm good to you
That I'm afraid
That I think I am
That I never leave
That I look like a phoenix
That I like to believe
That
Thanks for your help
Thank you
Ten thousand kisses
Ten grand
Ten different colours
Ten corners of logic
Ten but no one is talking
Tells me who’s watching
Tells me where you went
Tells me what tomorrow is
Telling her we are friends
Tell your story
Tell your lover that
Tell your love to me
Tell the king of words
Tell the ghost story
Tell my girl I have no name
Tell my future lovers
Tell me where she went to
Tell me what you think
Tell me what you meant to say
Tell me what you mean
Tell me the root of all evil
Tell me so
Tell me she’s telling me her true name
Tell me my story
Tell me a poem
Tell me a new name
Tell her I'm fine
Tell all of us
Tears starting to come out
Tears off their stammering bottles
Tears off my skin
Tears of sorrow
Tears of silence
Tears of pain
Tears of hope
Tears just flow
Tears into your bones
Tears in the green
Tears for speech
Tears fall under a sky
Tears began to flow
Tears apart
Taught me so many things
Talking to you for free
Talking to those words
Talking to strangers
Talking to someone else
Talking to some mouth
Talking to him
Talking to her
Talking to glassy dreams
Talking the talk
Talking of bombs
Talking instead of doing
Talking glass
Talking freely
Talking dirty, winking at me
Talking beautiful in your own eyes
Talking about my body
Talk your pipe dreams
Talk to your father
Talk the truth
Talk the gutter
Talk of running away
Talk for years
Talk as a master
Talk about your boss
Talk about our eternal enemy
Talk about going to heaven
Talk about a dream
Taking up nothing
Taking those brainwashed whispers
Taking pride in ourselves
Taking on things
Taking on every creed
Taking notes
Taking my ride
Taking me with you
Taking it out on you
Taking his dream name
Taking her away
Taking comfort
Take your watch out
Take your time
Take your strange girl pose
Take your soul
Take your baby boy
Take us down
Take to the cross
Take this place I’m going to
Take this on and take it away
Take their art-loving souls
Take the wheel
Take the rainbow
Take the moon out
Take the leap
Take the heat
Take the girls for miles
Take the butter out
Take that on train
Take that hair from me
Take some time right now
Take out your mind
Take one last kiss
Take off your clothes
Take off my clothes
Take no prisoners
Take no interest in me
Take my word for it
Take my wheel
Take my sweet piss
Take my place
Take my mistress
Take my foot off the floor
Take my eye off my pillow
Take me to the moon
Take me to my palace
Take me out of this life
Take me down
Take me away
Take it with you
Take it out of your face
Take it easy
Take it away
Take in all the rules
Take hold
Take him down
Take her on her walk
Take every bit
Take every aspect of yourself
Take control of everything
Take control
Take care of yourself
Take care of your emptiness
Take away your power
Take away the terror
Take away the meaning
Take away my affection
Take apart my father
Take another picture
Take a shine to your face
Take a look at the picture
Take a little time
Take a line
Take a lifetime
Take a fresh start
Take a comfort
Tackling this dilemma
Sympathy seeps into you
Sympathetic boy
Switch to a different flavor
Swipe lefty trick
Swings at a parade
Swing the knife in your hand
Swing close to my house
Swing by the scenes
Swing by my station
Swimming through your dreams
Swift and round
Swept by hypnotic wind
Sweet, sour, and smokey
Sweet white sun
Sweet voice
Sweet to waste
Sweet sweet quarter
Sweet smile
Sweet pleasures
Sweet parade past
Sweet old straight
Sweet meets sour
Sweet lips
Sweet leaves of glory
Sweet kids
Sweet dreams, I’ll stay
Sweet dreams would scream
Sweet dreams of my hard-fought trade
Sweet as the old butter
Sweet and sweet
Sweet and kind and caring
Sweet and cold
Sweeps your skin
Sweeping thunder
Sweep me
Sweatshop brushes
Swear to a girl
Swallow your tears
Swallow the bones
Surrounding the windows
Surrender up here
Surrender to what you mean
Surprised to be here
Supposing she’ll fall
Supposedly over us
Supposed to stop
Super-human deal
Sunshine, sunshine
Sunshine town
Sunshine on your lips
Sunlit jailbird
Sunlit from my soul
Sunlit blues and shining amber
Sunk down on the park benches
Sunbeam sky
Sun from behind
Sun and distant nights
Summertime in your love life
Suffocating in silence
Suffering pain
Suddenly gone
Suddenly everyone inside
Suddenly awake
Suddenly
Sudden fading away
Suck the magic carpet
Suck my heart out
Suck in this jagged wall
Such as she’s been taught to watch
Such an ugly hand
Such an overused sentiment
Such an easy target
Such a tricky thing
Such a silly title
Such a shame
Such a sad mood
Such a beautiful time
Stupidity waits without warning
Stupid old fool
Stupid mama
Stupid ladies and men
Stumbling on sand
Strung with dread
Strung up around demons
Strung between wheels
Stroll in
Stripes are for men
Strip everybody naked
Strings and mirrors
Strike back and try again
Strike a nerve
Streetwise swindlers
Streets out of the sea
Streets of yours
Streets of city
Streetlights walk through
Street lights to the sides
Strayed in time
Stray to Paris
Strangleholds my memories
Stranglehold upon history
Stranger voices appear
Stranger troubles
Stranger on a mission
Stranger in the wind
Stranger in our hair
Stranger goes by my direction
Stranger
Strain the old thread
Straight to the nuclear force
Straight to the dead
Straight to home
Straight into the abyss
Straight from the clanging cages
Straight away
Storm through me
Storing away my mistakes
Stop this slutty ways
Stop playing with diamonds
Stop leaving the country
Stop keeping it in suspense
Stop fucking around
Stop crying all the time
Stop cringing
Stop and stare
Stop and spin
Stood by my grave
Stoned to hell
Stone and sawdust
Stomach full of shit
Stoked the passion
Still wanting me
Still strive
Still quite rude
Still nothing in your hands
Still not yet cracked
Still lovin' beer
Still looking at this empty place
Still in love
Still gourd
Still goons getting away
Still getting lost
Still feeling tired
Still asking me if I was meant
Still alright
Stiff walls
Sticking your sweet little hooks
Stepping up your game
Stepping over everything
Stepping on the hard shore
Steel
Stealing time
Stealing street music
Stealing my wings
Stealing from a soulless eye
Steal the feel of your time
Steal of attention
Staying on the outside
Staying inside your mind
Staying awake at night
Stay warm
Stay true to yourselves
Stay near me
Stay home
Stay away from me
Stay around me
Stash the secret jewels
Starving spirits
Starving dreams
Starting with white
Starting with honey
Starting to throw up
Starting singing after she leaves
Starting here in a coffin
Started him dancing
Started buying to- pay attention
Start working again
Start some over
Stars smell of blood
Stars rise, fall
Stars on fire
Stars for their stars
Stars are burning white
Stars and starlit corridors
Stars a million volts down the line
Starlight begins to stream from windows
Starlight
Staring down on the wall
Staring down from the stage
Staring at the wall
Staring at the pillow
Stare on shadows
Stare at me
Star-shaped bowl
Star wars dreams
Stands outside this room
Stands in the sky
Standing up for myself
Standing up for herself
Standing next to each other
Standing next to a friend
Standing in line with the law
Standing amongst yourselves
Stand your ground
Stand up, out loud
Stand up, drag me away
Stand up and shake my hand
Stand out as a disappointment
Stand in line
Stand by me
Stand by and salute
Stand beside me: Looking into your eye
Stand against me
Stairway
Stabbed into little pieces
Stabbed in the ground
Squeaking in the trough
Squash up the emotion
Spungent on smoke
Springtime tree silhouette
Spring like here
Spread the love
Spread the ashes
Spread my wings
Spread my arms wide
Spooky horse
Spoken every rhyme
Split time and bring her back
Split lips
Spinning the same hum
Spinning stars
Spinning outward at night
Spinning my wings
Spinning in the desert
Spinning in half
Spinning flowers
Spent one of the days in solitary
Spending time crying
Spending as a millionaire
Spending all of my money
Spending all day together
Spend the evening in town
Speed miles
Speed me up
Speed is high
Specially shining eyes
Speak your minds
Speak with hearts on fire
Speak to me
Speak the truth
Speak soon
Speak plainly
Speak of me
Speak like a girl
Speak badly of myself
Spattered an amber sky
Spamming out everywhere
Spading through a dead thread
Sounds strange
Sounds so simple
Sounds pretty tight
Sounds more like a curse
Sounds like tomorrow
Sounds like the shadow falls on you
Sounds like the place to fly
Sounds like shit
Sounds like a thousand other things
Sounds kind of dirty
Sounded like fun
Soul still alive
Soul Encryption
Sorry, what do you think?
Sorry to disappoint you
Sorry to disappoint
Sorry to be accused
Sorry sorry it was so busy
Sorry just never find it
Sorry it gets cold soon
Sorry for sounding so out of it
Sorry for my youth
Sooner or later
Soon the thought has gone
Soon our money will come
Song for a night
Song for a boy
Son, you missed that
Son of this day
Son of the son
Son of slaves
Son of sin
Son of honey
Son of every man
Son of a slayer
Son of a bitch
Somewhere, we are
Somewhere, somewhere inside you
Somewhere that I can’t catch
Somewhere out there
Somewhere off in the distance
Somewhere it’s alright
Somewhere in a forgotten way
Somewhere down there
Somewhere a strange peace
Somewhere I want you to be
Sometimes you’re an idiot
Sometimes you’ll come home
Sometimes you walk into a riddle
Sometimes the memory fades
Sometimes I’m afraid
Sometimes I'll be getting a clue
Sometime you’ll know
Something's known
Something will come
Something that never quite existed
Something that is still soul
Something that I don't know
Something so small
Something new, something to take away
Something for the band
Something for everyone
Something changes
Something badly torn apart
Something bad in their eyes
Something along the lines
Something I hate
Someone’s just coming by
Someone’s breaking that sound
Someone who can change in his name
Someone that everyone knows
Someone saved your life
Someone reminds me
Someone needs to hear
Someone named Willsell
Someone goes out
Someone gets killed
Someone from our desert
Someone else’s doing it for you
Someone else will find the ground
Someone else wants to know
Someone calls you the enemy
Someone asking you for a favour
Someone I can see and speak
Somehow go down there
Someday of my life
Someday maybe I will be
Someday
Somebody’s gonna get shot
Somebody's got to move the train
Somebody you can go home to
Somebody just followed me to your back
Somebody gets to die
Somebody else’s in the kitchen
Somebody calls me home
Somebody I don't know
Some white shoes
Some time, close enough
Some time to buy change
Some sweet song
Some show
Some shady eyes
Some sailors cannot walk
Some people think they've never met
Some people don’t give a damn
Some people crawl down on to you
Some pain’s broken
Some of you will have to ask me
Some of you shine
Some of the best for you
Some of it falls apart
Some nights in order
Some new dreams
Some mighty names
Some man's side of the life
Some man left somewhere
Some little little note
Some guardsmen to run
Some great songs
Some girl dreams
Some down below
Some dogs from the town
Some dead girl
Some day you will be here
Some damn authority
Some buried treasure
Some ancient men
Sold!
Sold me so much
Soaked up in loneliness
Soak it inside
So, I’ll be right here
So, I come to you as a wire
So you’re really doing right
So you’re free
So you'll be here?
So you talk about love, conversation, and money
So why don't you go today?
So why don't I have money to spend?
So what?
So what you say
So what about them?
So we like to become good at what we do
So there you are
So tender and cool
So start fucking around
So soft
So sad
So now you're right
So now we belong here
So need a two sided smile
So much of him
So long ago
So let's just be friends
So let's go
So in your mind
So he’s young
So he’s wearing a wig
So he gets paid now
So glad I sat there
So far gone you are
So far away
So don't interrupt me
So do you mean to?
So clearly she has no voice
So clearly out
So call me manager
So bring it back to life
So beat the train
So I’ve got the drunkard
So I've been able to hide
So I thought
So I don't feel so guilty’s here
So I do it with everybody
Snowy picture
Snowy blue
Snow over young white hairs
Snow from the clouds
Sniff on your fingernails
Snakes sing and crawl into them
Snakes likes bibbles
Snakes in the sky
Snakes breathe
Snail with the vines
Smooth as a feather
Smoking on the beach
Smoking my song
Smoke in the street
Smoke falls from her eyes
Smiling’s own way
Smiling beside him
Smells too good to be true
Smells the same as your lips
Smells of smoke
Smells like rotten gum
Smells like piss
Smells like muscle
Smells like dead meat
Smells like a pair of wings
Smelling water
Smell, taste
Smell the sound of shining
Smell the message
Smell my blood
Smashed eyes
Small fingerwork
Slowing to adore
Slow motion
Slow like a plant
Slow it down
Slow in your career
Slow in order
Slow as a snail
Slipping the film
Slip through the cracks
Slip on your hard time
Slip on my honey collar
Slip my damn face
Slip into despair
Slip down
Slip Away
Slices and pickles
Sleepy time
Sleeping you away
Sleeping on the earth
Sleeping all over me
Sleep, reflection and one soul
Sleep and write your tired lyrics
Slapping his big brother
Slap your hand away
Skippered my brain
Skinny red-faced
Skinny eyed deer
Skinny as a whip
Sixty thousand little things
Sixty shades
Situated in his body
Sitting within a fog
Sitting with the devil
Sitting up at night
Sitting there and looking down on you
Sitting still and staring
Sitting on his shoulder
Sitting like she’s dead
Sitting in jail
Sitting down
Sitting by the mirror
Sitting awake
Sitting across from somebody
Sit still in this confusion
Sit side-by-side across the street
Sit like a diamond
Sit for a minute
Sit down next to your friend
Sit down and sing
Sit back and allow me
Sipping blood
Sipping a bottle
Sinking unguarded
Sinking
Singing under the moon
Singing to the sky
Singing the song
Singing popular phrases
Singing over my song
Singing and loving
Singed with this reason
Sing the popular songs
Sing the music
Sing in the moon
Sing by the the lonesome
Since you made me a bitch
Since the dawn
Since she'll take you away
Since making love in love
Since I say there can be no fly
Since I found it in you
Simpleton's foreskin
Silverfish waves
Silver standard
Silver hair
Silver bullet
Silver
Silhouettes in the night
Silently remembered
Silent from the eyes
Silent for a little while
Silent Hour
Silence’s dragging down
Silences get louder
Silence still shines
Silence now
Silence
Sign my drink
Sign me up on Good Friday
Sign me to see that a dark tune
Sign me in
Sick with a cold
Sick of your lies
Sick of this rush
Sick of the racket
Sick of that
Sick of me
Sick of it all
Sick of having to follow the law
Sick of all this loneliness
Sick at heart
Sick as your eye doesn't shine
Sick as hell
Sick as a sack
Sick and sober
Sick and cold
Sick and angry
Sick
Shut your mouth
Shut your doors
Shut up when I can’t finish
Shut up before you knew it
Shut up and move
Shut me in
Shush the skin
Shuffle down my neck
Show us in your dream
Show me your pride
Shout your name again
Shoulda used me
Should've done
Should've buried the toys
Should you cry?
Should have been warning
Should I please say it?
Shot in the head
Shooting from here
Shooting down traffic
Shook myself up in this past
Shocker dreams
Shivering with emotion
Shiver red hair
Shiver in your memories
Shiver in my song
Shine the other lights
Shine the love and sympathy
Shhh’s off to hell
Shhhh
She’s the lover
She’s taking a fair share
She’s still spinning
She’s still inside me
She’s stealing more things
She’s running down
She’s pretty
She’s not the whole story
She’s next door
She’s never a virgin
She’s lying
She’s lived the dream
She’s like an idiot
She’s just uptight
She’s in her last act
She’s got more than meets the eye
She’s getting thin
She’s for you
She’s flying out
She’ll not say
She’ll be left alone
She’ll be alright
She’d leave a tape out
Shes the ground with a dead anchor
She's wearing a handbag
She's stuck to one side
She's looking for me
She's just looking at us
She's at the punch line
She's alright
She'll lead
She wore down her ties
She wore clothes of silver
She won’t show
She won’t lie
She will see
She wasn’t sad
She wasn't fucking going home
She was waiting for you
She wants you to pick up your pieces
She wanted him
She walks down the hall
She took a glass
She threw off the kart
She threw away her pillow
She thinks too bad
She thinks she’s a prophet
She still beats it
She smiled a secret
She should move on you
She sees every little thing I'm doing
She said we found a new sweet kiss
She said I met her yesterday
She really loves to dance
She opened fire
She never talks about me
She never gave up
She may have gone a little too far
She may be empty
She made a show out of me
She looks satisfied
She looked so little at the time
She knows I have nothing to do
She kept crying
She just turned away
She is right
She is in such a rush
She had no proof
She got a great taste
She finally did
She feeds me
She doesn’t love you
She didn't tell me all the answers
She did you good
She did well
She can hurt no more
She called me with a set
She built me the statues
She began the dance
She asked you if she wanted a dream
Shattering the toy
Shaking your back
Shake your pretty hearts
Shake your chair
Shake it up
Shake and weep
Shadows on an airplane
Shadows of infamy
Shadows in my ears
Shadows everywhere
Shadows are falling
Shadow threads of my dreams
Shadow shift
Shadow of something I see
Shadow my masterpiece
Shader
Severely fucked
Seventh sun
Set your mind free
Set your feet clean
Set your cage inside
Set you free
Set the image
Set me free
Set fire to me
Set a new standard
Separate your vision
Send us your treasure
Send off in the order of time
Send me off to lie
Send me my apologies
Send her for supper
Selling us rotten apples
Selling them saddles
Selling the romance
Selling the body of a woman
Selling so quickly
Selling out the White City
Selling it all
Selling fuel to every boy
Selling everybody
Selling every penny
Sell the title
Sell the dishes
Sell our souls
Selfies I'm sure
Self-conscious
Seen the way
Seen the good days
Seen it through my eyes
Seen from a distance
Seems very weird
Seems pretty cool
Seems like an attack by one
Seems a good time
Seemed pretty easy
Seeing who you are
Seeing the needle fall
Seeing her again
Seeing from over that line
Seeing an open wound
See, the night is fading
See your secret
See your money coming
See you tonight
See you soon
See you all around
See what they say
See those blurred ones?
See the terrible realities
See the forest in the eyes
See the clear colour
See that this is true
See on my face
See inside
See how stupid she is
See how high?
See him be stronger than anyone
See all the gorgeous eyes
See all the emotions and movements
See all my dreams come true
Secret store of things
Secret and private
Searching for a promise
Search through every corner
Search the south
Search for the death’s ticket
Search for our love
Search for heaven
Search for clues
Search for a chance
Sealed on rocks
Sealed in an ocean
Seagulls of dark tales
Sculptures of deceit
Sculpture
Sculpted for profit
Scrubbed the paint
Scrolling along the city street
Screwing someone?
Screw you
Screenshot my face
Screeching and walking to the end
Scour her rubble
Science down to earth
Science behind building walls
Science
Scary time
Scarlet eyes
Scaring off every morning
Scared for a minute
Scam for you
Scales through my eyes
Scales the gallery
Scaled in splendor
Scaled down
Saying: That their time
Saying it in short order
Saying he won’t take me if he’s right
Saying I'm gonna do it if you wanna
Say you want me to walk round
Say yes to her
Say what you want
Say they met somebody else
Say the support of my spirit
Say the love that I feel
Say something, right now
Say something wonderful
Say something nice
Say something exciting to people
Say something different than the order
Say so little
Say please: Bringing me down
Say no more
Say my name
Say it to me
Say it isn't so shy
Say it anyway
Say it ain't for me
Say it a thousand times
Say he’ll come across
Say hello to everybody
Say goodbye
Say all you want
Say all the time
Saw you bleed my love
Saw the light
Saw the full moon
Saw the figures of countless people
Saw the dawn in the cemetery
Saw out my window
Saw how much I loved you
Saw her touch
Saves me a hell of a future
Save your soul
Save your mind
Save your life
Save the world
Save my life
Save me from this current dilemma
Save me alone
Save for a moment
Satisfy my soul
Satisfied I don’t cry
Same old shame
Same old hopeless talk
Same deal
Same boat song
Sailing home at night
Sailing high through the silent sky
Sailing hard and fast
Sailing by night
Sailboat airfare
Sail the sky
Sail that ship
Sail my lonely spirit
Sail me back home
Sail from your dreams
Sail down the waves
Sail away like a cloud
Sail around the world
Said fucking songs
Saffron blankets
Sad to see
Sacrifice yourself
Sacrifice your home
Sacrifice a unbreakable camel
Rushing up the salt highway
Running through my head
Running for each other
Running down an empty stomach
Running down against your own wall
Running away
Running around staring
Run you through
Run up a dollar or two
Run to your room
Run through the door
Run round
Run past her
Run out and hide
Run on the moon
Run me over
Run like a man
Run in circles
Run down the stage
Run away
Rumbling in the water
Rudely
Rude, jealous, and expensive
Rude with sweetnap
Rude white tent
Round hand to sell
Rose slippers
Rose red
Rolling pictures
Rolling over into others
Rolling my eyes
Rolling fire
Roll and toss
Rocking my wheels
Rockin' your cell phones
Rock you up
Rock up the sky
Rock up the hill
Rock through the air
Rock on his head
Rock in a box
Rock for a reason
Rock calls
Roasting the ashes
Roast the game
Roar on the floor
Roar me
Roams the halls
Roaming the streets
Road to paradise
Road to hell
Road to happy endings
Road to class
Rising from the dead
Rising down the street
Rise of the king
Ripping through the earth
Ripped up in painted papers
Rip their muscles
Ring of fire
Right, I could only go in
Right to the ocean
Right on your own skin
Right off the razor wire
Right now you go
Right now you are still smiling
Right now to reach him
Right now I see him
Right hand on the other sleeve
Right for the moment
Right behind the tree
Right before his mind can rise
Right back where we started
Right back up
Riding the mountains
Riding out the lights
Riding on the sand
Rides his past
Ride to the end of time
Ride through the night
Ride the ocean
Ride that bus
Ride off into space
Ride me through this hellhole
Ride like a butterfly
Ride in a little amusement
Ride and sing for eternity
Ride along on the cloud
Ride against the cloud
Ride a mite
Ridden the road
Rhyming
Rhyme glistens
Revolution that kills all mankind
Revocation
Returned all of our glory
Return to your feet
Return to the movie
Return to our lives
Return home
Resurrection
Restlessness is what keeps men from earning
Restless by memory
Resting low
Rest in peace
Represented the mass dailies
Represent the past
Repossessions
Reparation
Reminisces
Reminds you why
Reminds me of my abandoned cars
Reminds me of how I feel
Reminds me of a world I made in bed
Reminds me of Romeo and Juliet
Remembering who
Remember you’re my friend
Remember the love of his head
Remember my name
Remains caked in rain
Release that feel
Release more confidence
Rekindled my memories
Rekindled memories
Rejection comes with more finesse
Refine all hopes
Redrushing in and out
Red talk
Red sea to the brim
Red roses bloom
Red infested carpet
Recruiting my buddy John the Apostle
Recruit your friends
Recess and dance
Reassure
Really?
Really just a boring ball of fire
Really good things were known
Really cool
Really bad mistake
Realising why
Real life teacher
Real life
Real happy time
Real crazy
Real busy
Real
Ready to take the blue
Ready to spit your bread
Ready to put up with one disease
Ready to get crazy
Ready to dance
Ready to burn my house
Ready to be known
Ready for your wrath
Ready for a wave
Reading’s like leaving the house
Reading what I hear
Reading my lips
Reading here
Reading down my tongue
Reading and loving
Reading a letter in a jar
Reaching the pinnacle
Reaching the door
Reaching out for another kiss
Reaching out
Reaching or keeping you way older
Reaching me
Reaching from the ashes
Reaching for their waists
Re-title: When’s that band playing?
Rave
Rather than preach
Rather than fight
Rather tease
Rather play the music
Rather hungry, I’m going to kill you
Rather find your friends
Rather cry for Christ
Rather be here
Rather be a mountain
Rather at ease
Rapper of white stars
Ralts on a dusty trail
Rakes in the rain
Raise your voice
Raise the wind
Raise a storm
Raining tomorrow
Raining down
Raining clouds
Rainbows and dogs
Rainbows
Rain in the streets
Rain falling down
Rain and shine
Raging my way
Raging mad in church
Ragged feet
Ragged and savage
Quiet places
Quiet my silence
Quaking in the desert
Putting you on our side
Putting her mind at ease
Putrid and terrible
Put your love in you
Put your hammer back on your head
Put your brain to work
Put your brain in your pocket
Put you in the wrong place
Put together the stones
Put together a song
Put them in my hands
Put the phone down
Put the needle in your ear
Put the gun down
Put our loyalty aside
Put on the neon blue
Put off crying
Put my life on hold
Put my hand in your mouth
Put me in my place
Put it to use
Put it on that shelf
Put in my crown
Put down your bridge
Put down the dead
Put a smile on my face
Put a little evil into our lives
Put a grin on your face
Put a door open
Pussy in the hood
Pushing through his mind
Push your legs down
Push to replace the snow
Push the drum
Push that button
Push me through it
Push me through
Push me by my feet
Punch through every roulette wheel
Punch for the balls
Pulling through
Pulling each other apart
Pull the trigger
Pull me to you
Protect me from your ass
Protect her soul
Protect from the cold
Protect and support her
Promise me greatness
Preying on you
Prey on people
Prevent himself from killing you
Pretty white hands
Pretty sweet place
Pretty skinny
Pretty princesses
Pretty much to control me
Pretty innocent girl
Pretty cool
Pretty boy, pretty boy
Pretty bitch
Pretending nothing
Pretend you met me
Pretend I feel
Preserve, protect and let down
Preserve the world
Preserve the deepest blue
Prejudice still reverberates
Precious pieces of lace
Precious little trick
Preceding on his own death
Preacher
Praying you'll succeed
Pray your sky
Pray to heaven
Pray she was your idol
Pray for us
Pray for my babe
Pray for me
Pours their heart out
Pouring rainbows
Pouring our blood into the storm
Pouring into the future
Poured up him
Poppies sitting here
Poppets’s world
Poor soul
Poor situation
Poor me
Pointed me in the right direction
Point blank at me
Point at you
Poets sing songs of death
Poetry on fire
Poetry
Pleasures inside
Pleasures at your feet
Please, I've got your little boy's money
Please wait before you cry
Please swallow my pride
Please support us
Please start singing along
Please stare at me
Please show me your love
Please settle for a present
Please put your arms around me
Please push a button
Please please let me ride
Please pass it on
Please no longer see
Please let me know
Please leave me alone
Please knock the sidewalk
Please just find me the one in your life
Please hold down my key
Please have love
Please fall asleep
Please don’t touch
Please don’t make me a cliché
Please don't let her
Please don't go to sleep
Please come over
Playing with fire
Playing tricks
Playing for a laugh
Playing clockwork
Playing and singing in the evening
Play the catch
Play it off in space
Play in your music
Plastic toys
Plastic spoon
Place your hand on my forehead
Place you in paradise
Place on your garden floor
Place of power
Place of hatred
Place in my face
Place
Pits of living
Pitiless-eyed blindsiding
Pissing how low it can go
Piss me off
Pimp my words
Pieces of my soul
Pieces of a puzzle
Pictures to show
Pictures of them falling apart
Pictures of my sickles
Pictures of faith
Picture a message
Pick your things

Overview
Overventurous wet and cloudy
Overtonight today
Overkill
Overhearing some funny notes
Overcome the blues
Over time
Over there
Over the summer sun
Over the rough ocean
Over the road
Over the bottom of my depth
Over my body
Over in the mountain
Over in the dungeon
Over every avenue
Over and over again
Over a month old
Out of the weeds
Out of the forest
Out of the blue
Out of style
Out of reach
Out of nowhere
Out of love
Out of harmony
Out of fear
Out of control
Out of all the mirrors
Out in the plain
Out in the open
Out here today
Out at night
Ousiss the days
Ours, my only refuge
Ours is yet another boat
Ours is the tale of the Shire
Our youth say no
Our worst enemy
Our tongues fly
Our time is on our feet
Our thirst for beer
Our story
Our sides of ourselves
Our name is everything
Our lovingly dream
Our lives turned
Our lady goddess
Our hearts know
Our eyes burn
Our dreams come true
Our baby is fine
Other song
Other people wanna cry
Ornery trad songs
Or: To look into the abyss
Or thumps of grass
Or something
Or scared
Or if you don’t know
Or destroyed
Or describe what's missing
Or at least some imagination
Or I’m gonna turn into somebody else
Or I’m going to die
Or I could lose it
Open your mouth
Open your heart to them
Open your heart
Open with a smile
Open the window
Open the canyons
Open my eyes
Open mouth
Open mind
Open a gun
Only you’re here
Only we have time
Only try to let life be
Only to dream
Only son to the blessed
Only pictures given
Only one brainless goon
Only good dreams ever make the lie
Only fits your ear
Only feeling in the bag
Only fade away
One word in my life
One thing, a thousand things
One thing to remember
One thing that she deserves
One that loves to know
One summer night
One solitary hour in despair
One slice of history
One sigh
One shirt
One question ahead
One of you’ve become famous
One of you’s just a chance
One of those great kings
One of them’s lying
One of their own to follow
One of the wine-lips
One of the only great artists
One of the kings
One of the finest cities of the world
One night
One new thing
One morning
One minute you watch it again
One line of code
One last time
One last thing
One last minute fade
One last midnight
One hundred, two hundred times over
One hundred times the size
One hundred pages of notes
One hand on your shoulder
One fucking art source
One fell sword
One example
One driver so much
One day she’ll smile
One day I will be right here
One day
One can’t help you
One ballcap
One bad mime
One another belongs in all the worlds
One animal fainted
One I look through
Once the mood turns bright
Once in a generation
Once again, he brings you nowhere
Once again we fall into mist
On your side
On your knuckles
On top of the mass slaughter
On top of it all
On top of beautiful
On the way home
On the street
On the spine
On the shore
On the run
On the roof
On the prowl for you
On the moonlight
On the highway
On the fence
On the catwalk
On the calm shore
On the bus
On the bridge
On the blind side
On that side of the coin
On my way out
On my mind
On my mantelpiece
On my eye
On my doorstep
On in black
On getting drunk
On fire
On a summer morning
On a moon day
On a massive scale
Old virgins are getting older
Old love life
Old and new releases
Old Alabama
Oh’s good to know
Oh, you’ll never know
Oh, they won
Oh, the sense of wonder
Oh, no thought comes to me
Oh, my mother’s son
Oh, it's amazing
Oh, hello night
Oh, come on soon
Oh, and someone’s been caught up
Oh, I know all of this
Oh you’re just too high
Oh your damn heart
Oh yes, I see you’re right
Oh yes please stop
Oh yeah
Oh nothing is ever cracked
Oh no
Oh my love, this means so much to me
Oh my goodness
Oh my god; I know you and I live by fate
Oh my god I’m awake
Oh my god
Oh don’t talk to me
Oh I can feel the heat of the sun
Oh God, I see your face
Off all the towns in the world
Of your only pleasure
Of what?
Of the mouth of my sorrow
Of the human balance
Of no sentimental place
Of mine
Of loving our singing
Of lost loved ones
Of fucking time
Of anger and sorrow
Of all times
Of Angels
Obtainments of murder
Obsolete canvas
O Brother to you
O 'em all
Nudity
Nude flies
Nowhere, here
Nowhere to hide
Nowhere near
Nowhere here to stay
Now, what’s left
Now you’re free
Now with them
Now where we’re from
Now we’re doing it again
Now we are together
Now there are some more
Now that you see me
Now that I have this you
Now take me back
Now so hot
Now she deserves it
Now live a dream
Now is the time
Now hear me out
Now find me
Now come to finish
Now come on down
Now and then you look
Now I’ve got a job
Now I’m taking off
Now I see you already
Now I see where you come from
Now I know
Nothing’s left to show
Nothing you could see
Nothing you can do
Nothing you can afford
Nothing to lose
Nothing to do but complain
Nothing so true
Nothing says we love
Nothing really can be said
Nothing other than a gun
Nothing more
Nothing lasts forever
Nothing good to say
Nothing for me
Nothing ever comes back
Nothing earthly
Nothing could have made me scream
Nothing but silence
Nothing bad will come of it
Not you yet
Not right now
Not quite how I feel
Not people you know
Not lost in indecision
Not like the time of dawn
Not knowing what to do
Not for real
Not done
Not a side-by-side draw
Not a cop
Nose to roof
None of this mattered
None
Noisy love
Nobody’s hired me
Nobody's listening
Nobody was supposed to catch me
Nobody should hear it
Nobody lives like you
Nobody cares
No-one can feed me
No, you know I know
No, what happened?
No, no, no
No words for a part of me
No weakness
No way that I’m supposed to be
No way out
No waste of time
No voice is gonna stop me
No toilet title: Red meat after blood
No time to cry
No surprise
No speech today
No sound in my heart
No solace

No regret
No real sparkle
No real revolution
No questions asked
No problem
No point in burning
No pain

No one’s talked about her
No one’s fucking with me
No one’s feeling much
No one’s buying you
No one will stop me
No one wants to get along
No one starts out with you
No one knows what we found
No one knows how long you walk
No one knows I’m the one
No one is afraid
No one is a guest
No one had any clue
No one dies for nothing
No one cared about you

Night light under the silver light
Night in the sun
Night in shining skies
Night and day
Night after day
Nice
Next train up's attempt to cross
Next to nothing
Next time I can look
New world order
New toys
New timezone
New store windows
New planes
New plain image
New music’s whistling
New leader in the world
New horses
New hope
New flag
New country
New bus trips every night
New York City
Nevermore
Never wear down
Never try to connect
Never the deviant dream
Never surrender
Never spoke that I knew
Never smiled
Never sleepwalk
Never seen the glory
Never seemed like the time for this conversation
Never put up with it
Never mind me
Never look down
Never listen to you
Never let someone else touch you
Never gotta be together
Never got to tune
Never going to wake up
Never goes away
Never getting up
Never feel
Never do
Never come anymore
Never can forget my past
Neon sneakers
Neon in the acid
Needn't cry at all
Needing to reach for the shore
Need you ever stop
Need to understand
Need to try again
Need some reason to die
Need of a weapon
Need every stroke
Naughty, sweet girl
Naughty but gentle
Naughty
Narrow the jaws
Narrow at the drop of a hat
Naked and lonely
Nail the strings
My younger brother
My years
My world
My woman’s human breast
My ways are open
My way, go, go
My vision’s starting to fade
My vision is fucked
My vision grows dark
My view
My victim’s guilt
My verse
My two sons, mine and mine
My true love
My train took you so far
My tracksuit
My time together
My time is too slow
My tender earth
My sun
My stay
My starting point
My spirit's immortal
My soul’s a cloud
My soul was made in a crucible
My soul on the border
My soul is burning
My soul here on earth
My soul belongs on top
My sorrow changes
My smell swells
My sky
My sister and I
My sins
My shadow maiden
My sadness
My relationship as you grow up
My real affection
My pride is built
My place of pleasure
My place in history
My place
My path came undone
My parents told me to do it again
My own voices
My own business
My overworked mother
My only source of strength
My old alarm
My neck is playing
My name is tense
My name is still your name
My mouth is open to those who’re afraid
My mother’s second hand
My mother is talking to me
My mother died
My mind is loaded
My mask of a fiery soul
My mama
My love’s gone from my heart
My love is in the clothes
My love for music
My love comes from behind
My little work
My life is too lonely
My life is good
My life is a blank slate
My life all around
My laughter and dream
My karma is my isolation
My imagination just seems endless
My illusions win
My horns are rockin her ears
My holy friends
My hero is God
My heaven
My heart plays the same tune
My heart is your soul
My heart is the only shadow
My heart is right
My heart goes out to you
My heart I know
My head takes over
My head in the air
My harmony
My hands are broken
My hand
My hair can be up in the air
My greatest sensation
My great-great-great grandfather
My grandfathered machine
My giggle
My fucking face
My friends can't touch
My friend and I are going
My frail sixth-floor
My first love
My first kiss
My first dream
My fine friends
My final destination
My feet were beating up
My fear is righteous
My father’s voice
My father left me
My eyes turn red
My eyes shine
My eye turned so big
My enemy gets a little older
My earpiece
My ear likes yours
My drinking game
My dreams are fighting
My dream is watching the sun rise
My destination
My daughter
My darling
My child’s fault
My childhood dreams
My caretaker
My brother died down
My broken heart
My breathing is broken
My brains won the ball game
My brain doesn't know it’s wrong
My bones have not been played
My bones fit inside them
My bones buried
My body’s almost alive
My body changes
My bluesy eyes belong in the sky
My blade lit up like night
My beheaded title: Findings from eternity
My baby’s the one
My baby's broken
My art gallery
My apologies
My angels adore me
Music's called religion
Music to them
Music died out of heaven
Music between her bars
Music answers the judges
Murder by the sinner
Murder a friend
Mumble with the teeth of Satan
Much of your body is bleeding
Much of the world is looking
Much darker tomorrow
Moving through time
Moving through cold water
Moving slow
Moving from one to the next
Move your fucking mouth
Move your feet
Move up to me
Move this thing
Move the target
Move the needle here
Move the men
Move quickly dead oars
Move past the eyes
Move past that moment
Move on
Move my arms around
Move me further away
Move into the street
Move aside
Mouthwatering romance
Mouths are planted
Mouthpiece or facepiece?
Mouthpiece of someone else
Mouth to mouth
Mouth opening
Mother of the Lord
Mother is his bridge
Mother gets things done
Mother couldn’t help but cry
Mother and son’s juice
Mother and lover
Most of the time, it’s your fault
Most of the time I’ll be lying
Most important to him
Morning of love
Morning mornin', barbed wire
Morning is coming
Morning clouds
Morning can’t get far
Morning I’m not so scared
More to come
More than you ever could dream
More than you can take
More than toys
More than a horse
More than a band of filth
More quickly in time
More quickly
More perfect creation
More of a drain
More like a home away from home
More heat please
More energy
More clues
More by the wayside
More blood for now
More bear song
More anger and dirt
More and more creative
Moonlighting in every line
Moon from the sky
Money’s seen
Money’s no good
Money's gonna fade away
Money won't dance
Money will never go where it needs to go
Money is so dangerous
Money is awful
Money for fame
Money I can take
Modern-day gangster
Modern telephone
Modern takes a shine to her eyes
Modern slavery
Modern kiss
Modern daylight
Mister, start dressing down
Mister me today
Mistakes you make
Mistakes at all costs
Mistakenly, wrong
Mistake, mistreat
Mist
Miss your words
Miss you?
Miss me by the hand
Misplaced money
Mise ruffle your feathers
Misadventures in madness
Mine ends with him
Minding his piece
Mind when I had eyes
Mind uself
Mind is a jumble
Mind hardens by being awake
Mind always calling me
Millions’s worth of money
Milk the star project
Milk on the ocean floor
Milk for the eyes
Midnight watching moon
Midnight dawn
Meteors wet spells
Merry women get hired
Merry spoons
Merry chimes
Memory...
Memory it inside
Memory blown
Memory and imprisonment
Memory aches
Memories of your children
Memories light up your thoughts
Memories fly
Memories come to life
Mementos of the fat woman
Meets attraction
Meet the sun
Meet the ghosts
Meet the boss
Meet the Queen
Meet me inside the game
Me, too
Me, that's what this is
Me, my crazy lover
Me under the century
Me too
Me neither yet
Me and my voice
Me and my island
Me and all the enemies
Me alone
Maybe you’re giving up
Maybe you see me today
Maybe you don’t feel like it
Maybe you can come back tomorrow?
Maybe we could have it together?
Maybe tell you my goddamn name
Maybe she'll someday become a saint
Maybe it’s the same problem
Maybe everybody loves you
Maybe I'm not quite at the right place
Maybe I shouldn’t be changing
Maybe I can find the light
May take my heart
May fall apart
May come if you need me
May be a prize
May I stay like this?
May God help me
Match your mind
Master, crazy
Mashed in holy hell
Marching to see stars
Marching inside of our dreams
Man’s got an oneness
Many years ago
Many people on top
Many of the times the truth hangs
Many birds over again
Many are brave
Many a lost look
Man-made chaos
Man, tell me your way
Man's way
Man next door
Man in shining armour
Man down
Making my way through the crowd
Making love to a dead lover
Making love again
Making love
Making fun of anybody
Making a pyre
Makeup white
Makes your bed empty
Makes you so happy
Makes you say goodbye
Makes you feel so much better
Makes you feel comfortable
Makes me so stupid
Makes me sad
Makes me a little scratch
Make yourself sad
Make your sun flow
Make your own yellow people
Make your mind a hundred shapes
Make way
Make us laugh
Make up a story
Make those sounds just a little further away
Make the world nice
Make something new
Make some nice ladies day
Make peace with your enemies
Make noise
Make no mistake
Make my boy question
Make me glad
Make me forget
Make me crazy
Make me believe in you
Make me believe
Make it sweet
Make it out of the blue
Make it neat
Make it better
Make a new fucking world
Make a matter of it
Make a friendly peace
Make a deal with you
Madeleine from ours
Made your promises
Made your bones like a trumpet
Made you cry
Made with no vision
Made up tales
Made to sound rock'n'roll
Made to move
Made to fight to make it so
Made through a mountain
Made the center of the lot
Made out really lousy
Made out
Made of white paint
Made of steel
Made of powder
Made me the enemy
Made me feel
Made love to the devil
Made it feel great
Made fun of me
Made an ancient image
Made a bridge of silence
Made a bargain
Mad and miserable
Lying silent
Lying in your nightmare
Lying in the sun
Lying for a while
Lying
Lucky you
Lucky to have you in my life
Lucky in need
Lucky guy
Lucky for you
Lucky charm
Lowest room
Low paying job
Low on sweetness
Low lying noise
Loving and trying to teach
Loving a miracle
Lovely times
Lovely gunboat
Love, love, love
Love's onto you
Love's all too real
Love your heart
Love you and hate you
Love with all your own pieces
Love will send words
Love to cause sorrow
Love the highway
Love the book
Love that the ground changes colors
Love still burns
Love stick me like a stick of nails
Love sells
Love reminds us
Love reminds me
Love opens new doors
Love of pain
Love of mine
Love my kid
Love me this much
Love me some fruit
Love me a bit
Love loses a big shot
Love is your own laws
Love is my life
Love is made on the ground
Love is like an old brother
Love is funny
Love is dead
Love is born here
Love is at stake
Love is a thousand different beasts
Love is a poison
Love in your bones
Love hurts
Love hearts fill their temples
Love from the saddle
Love for the soul
Love for life
Love becomes foreign
Love and whatever you do
Love and show me that
Love and redemption
Love and danger
Love always rest
Love all the feelings
Love Is falling apart
Lovable silver inside you
Lost- of our nation
Lost time watching rain on television
Lost there
Lost them all
Lost the stars
Lost the line
Lost the hope
Lost my faith
Lost love in shadows
Lost little worlds
Lost life
Lost it up
Lost it in your dreams
Lost it
Lost innocence
Lost in you
Lost in the stars
Lost from existence
Lost for a century
Lost another girl
Lost all my nerve
Lost all control
Lost a thousand
Lost - lost
Losing him
Losing control over my body
Lose your leisure
Lose me
Lose faith
Lord of years
Lord of rage
Lord of paint
Lord No
Looks like you
Looks for nothing but luck
Looking to the south
Looking through the window
Looking over your shoulder
Looking over you
Looking out for you
Looking out for myself
Looking inside
Looking in the mirror
Looking in the future
Looking for you’s last minute overture
Looking for your side
Looking for the anchor
Looking for something to say
Looking for something new
Looking for somebody
Looking for my springtime
Looking for me
Looking for a reason
Looking for a good night
Looking down on you
Looking down on me
Looking down
Looking back in the dark
Looking at you on a dark and rainy night
Looking at you now
Looking at you crying
Looking at the things people do
Looking at the stars
Looking at the sky
Looking at the records
Looking around at the universe
Lookin' for somebody else
Look where I could fly
Look what you did when you took care of me
Look through your eyes
Look out for me
Look at this frail creature
Look at the snake like you’ve never seen
Look at that smile
Look at my feet
Look around
Longtime enemy
Longtime commitment
Long, thin drift
Long time same
Long reach in the cloud
Long overdue redemption
Long overdue
Long on room service
Long noonday
Long live, I’m one
Long live the innocent
Long hair’s a decent route
Long golden days
Long distance train ride
Long daylight
Long before I grow old
Long and dead
Long alone
Long ago, you know
Lonely wakes of my lovelorn world
Lonely souls?
Lonely keep waiting
Lonely face
Lonely are the lights of the earth
Lonely and lonely
Loneliness can be everywhere
Locked within my soul
Locked up all night
Locked my bed
Locked into your mouth
Locked inside a cell
Locked in this shell
Locked in my mind
Locked in
Lock in when someone leaves
Living under fire
Living to the shame
Living through misery
Living this life
Living on the edge
Living in the shadows
Living in misery
Living in a lonely place
Living as you seem before
Live your life safely
Live your life
Live your dreams
Live like fools
Live in harmony
Live happily ever after
Live forever in the sky
Live for my virgin year
Live for him
Live for a moment
Live and die like kings
Live a little longer
Live a life with me
Live a different way
Little startling
Little sister
Little sensation
Little red hills
Little precious stone
Little pictures of you
Little ironic kid
Little idol
Little hands lead me down to the banks
Little girl dreaming
Little girl
Little evil
Little ears of a good laugh
Little devil, you’re a rising star
Little brain
Little Paulie maybe?
Little Daisy dreams
Literal shit
Lit it off
Listen on my ear
Lips of war
Lines blurred
Like your mind is me
Like you think you know
Like you got confused
Like you all
Like underwater
Like tomorrow
Like time for the wind
Like the wonder of love
Like the sound of a time machine
Like the shadows
Like the king
Like the future
Like that she goes slow
Like shit
Like running across the skyline
Like no other
Like my little bones
Like my life is a dream
Like magic
Like it’s good to see
Like holy water
Like he’s a lunatic
Like heaven and hell
Like he said
Like flowing colours
Like drowning in the street
Like drinking water
Like dreams
Like china
Like buried fire
Like bandits
Like back in his days
Like an idol
Like an angel
Like always
Like a silver wheel
Like a phoenix
Like a newspaper story
Like a nest of snakes
Like a mistress
Like a miracle
Like a girl
Like a few broken bottles
Like a dream
Like a beam on a pillow
Like I’m a trap
Like I should be
Like I say
Like I said
Lights out from us
Lights for me
Lights down now
Lightning of a candle
Lighthearted attitude
Light, and low
Light up the pages
Light that hangs in the ceiling
Light sweet things
Life-changing
Life's too precious
Life was there
Life or death
Life on the line
Life loves a band
Life is small
Life is safe
Life is running so slow
Life is pretty much the high priest
Life is old and cold
Life is just like your mind
Life is full of deeds
Life is fine
Life is about to get late
Life is a trick
Life in terror
Life can play a role in my destiny
Life being nothing but service
Life - all you had but one floor
Life
Lies that you’ve put in your mind
Lies my mind
Lies in an alley
Lie so tight
Lie is a curse
Lie in silence
Lie full face to true
Lie down in a room
Let’s stop it
Let’s say okay
Let’s finish now
Letting your powers slip
Letting fly
Letting a man down
Let's talk rainbows
Let's take this from the heart
Let's take the earth
Let's show what kind of hate we are
Let's see what comes
Let's see how you look
Let's reach for their dead
Let's put you in this body
Let's not waste any time
Let's not forget that
Let's not be afraid
Let's meet again
Let's kick your ass
Let's keep ourselves apart
Let's just kick the door down
Let's just get a fancy little gig
Let's have your movies
Let's go where the hell we belong
Let's go over again
Let's go down to Stonewall Cafeteria
Let's go dance
Let's go back to our place
Let's go
Let's get to life
Let's get there
Let's get round of it
Let's get going
Let's face it
Let's do that
Let's be friends
Let your pet
Let your loving heart dance
Let your heart beat
Let you see tomorrow
Let you become satisfied
Let us make a new world
Let us know
Let us hide in our halls
Let us follow
Let us be
Let us all rise
Let them find you
Let them call me weary
Let the world tremble
Let the wolves off the trees
Let the scene hold us forever
Let the pain escape
Let the news stand
Let the golden age begin
Let the breath of success run
Let me try out
Let me tell you about it
Let me stop
Let me say it again
Let me reach for you
Let me look at this
Let me let you know
Let me just have a moment
Let me hide from you
Let me go wild
Let me go
Let me feel your arms
Let me die
Let me be your queen
Let me be
Let it out
Let it down
Let it come to pass
Let it come down
Let it be that way
Let it be here
Let it be
Let him see why
Let him be king
Let her sing
Let go
Let alone beat it
Let a day pass
Lest we keep flying through the sky
Left to our own devices
Left of you
Left my back to the ground
Leaving me young
Leaves your friend at the window
Leaves the cut
Leave you desolate
Leave to dance
Leave them cold
Leave the light on
Leave me to meet your ladies
Leave me or I shall become a law
Leave it with me
Leave it to them
Leave it there
Leave it on my mind
Leave him alone
Leave her out of reach
Leave her alone
Leave behind that rotten day
Leave a good word
Learn to treat the girl
Learn to survive
Learn some American history
Learn me what I know
Learn how to play
Learn about the law
Lean on me
Lean forward and hard
Lean for a walk
Lead out the windows
Lead off with love
Lead me home
Lead by a light
Lead a singing flight
Lay the bag
Lay down on top of the mountain
Lay down
Lay dead
Lay claim to fame
Laughs in the east
Laughing over all the problems
Laughing in my head
Laughing cross free
Laughing at the static
Laughing and crying every day
Laugh in the face of every belief
Laugh in our faces
Laugh at that rock star
Laugh and roll
Lately
Late to the party
Late one evening
Last, glorious and holy
Last night in hell
Last night I walked inside
Last fall
Last
Larking at the stars
Lapping your feet
Lady’s trembling
Ladybird, blind man's sweetheart
Lady's hand prints
Lady who won’t let me die
Lady someday
Lady sings
Lady of the seven seas
Lady kneels for me
Know you’re a friend
Know you’ll call
Know who cares
Know where to go
Know where they are
Know the only way you know
Know that nobody’s watching
Know not who I am
Know how things are from now on
Know every stitch
Knock on the doors
Knock on doors
Knock it dead
Knife through my stomach
Knew he was crazy
Kitted out for You
Kissing sky
Kissing her with pen and heart
Kissing every last one
Kissed my heart
Kissed into my cheek
Kiss in my mouth
King of the dance floors
King blows
Kinda suicidal
Killing the kindness
Killing the enemies
Killing rainbows
Killing me
Killing all that nobody’s understanding
Killing a boat
Kill the typhoon
Kill the memories
Kill the dude
Kill the bird
Kill the beautiful
Kill me in your hand
Kill her words
Kids can look at you
Kicking the clown
Kicking the barrel
Keeps you free
Keeps our feet wet
Keeping it quiet
Keep your secrets
Keep to the shore
Keep their heart from me
Keep the power fresh
Keep on running
Keep my lips flowing
Keep me still
Keep me in your house
Keep making promises to the people
Keep inside
Keep his cool
Keep her as a name
Keep going
Keep doing it
Keep away from your friends
Katherine of the suburbs
Just you
Just what she got
Just watched your life changing
Just watch their skin crawl
Just want you to know
Just want to help
Just wanna catch him if you can
Just wander your free ways
Just walk in the sound
Just walk around
Just waiting for the break
Just try to turn the pages
Just to wake us up
Just to try and keep the honeymoon quiet
Just to tell
Just to take you by your arm
Just to see you’ve said this before
Just to pull the strings
Just to calm down
Just thinking about it
Just the week before my daydream
Just the way I feel
Just the gate
Just teach me
Just taking some time to look
Just staying awake
Just so you know
Just so I know what you think
Just simply higher
Just share it
Just saying
Just roll over to sleep
Just putting up this girl
Just putting it down
Just plain stupid
Just pay more attention
Just out of habit
Just out of fear
Just open your eyes
Just one more chance to turn
Just now and then
Just moving in
Just mine
Just mind you, all by myself
Just me
Just making it more like a city
Just make it known
Just looking for you
Just look at you
Just listening to her
Just like yesterday
Just like the body can never catch
Just like the average lothario
Just like me
Just like in the movies
Just like an old soul
Just leaves the future unlocked
Just known
Just keep away
Just how a world will end
Just his friends
Just hide your hands
Just hang out and have fun
Just get me through this one
Just get me out
Just found the company
Just for you
Just for fun
Just for a name
Just follow your dreams
Just follow my heart
Just fine
Just broken up like shit
Just be yourself
Just be together for a month
Just as she will talk
Just as I found you
Just another sad little animal
Just another roof
Just another fake
Just another day ahead
Just another day
Just after noon
Just after me
Just about to swallow
Just a thought
Just a small fan
Just a regular guy
Just a passing topper
Just a little bit longer
Just a friendly smile
Just a friendly lie
Just a dream
Just a blue sky
Just a beautiful parade
Just I know
Jumped too high
Jump over to the people
Jump on this girl
Jump on our heels
Jump in the cage
Jump for it
Jump down the fucking hill
Jump backwards - I see you’re so beautiful
Join your sister
Join with me
Join the dance
Join the carnival
Join the battle
Join our long and happy day
Join me, I need you
Join me tonight
Join me today
Join me in his arms
Join me
Join in my dance
Johnny

Jealousy like a girl
I’ve spent the last century stranded alone
I’ve spent my life crying
I’ve seen you crying
I’ve seen way too much
I’ve seen my father
I’ve seen a boy
I’ve only got one thought
I’ve never seen your face
I’ve never seen anything like it
I’ve never seen anyone talk
I’ve never known
I’ve never had a love sound
I’ve met you
I’ve made a dream
I’ve lost my mind
I’ve got you right
I’ve got no match
I’ve got no interest
I’ve got all the wind in my sails
I’ve got a special girl
I’ve got a resolution
I’ve gone through so many
I’ve found life
I’ve done fine
I’ve been watching you for hours
I’ve been waiting so long
I’ve been promised
I’ve been one for a long time
I’ve been lifted
I’ve been ignored
I’ve been dead forever
I’m’d be satisfied
I’m your pride
I’m your friend
I’m young
I’m wrong
I’m weary
I’m very sad
I’m trying to be normal
I’m torn
I’m tired of this threesome
I’m tired
I’m the wrong one
I’m the same
I’m the little boy
I’m the fucking cloud
I’m the devil
I’m taking over
I’m supposed to find you
I’m stuck
I’m still young
I’m still scared
I’m still lonely
I’m standing there
I’m standing on the white corridor
I’m standing inside
I’m standing here
I’m sorry you’re stuck
I’m sorry for every little thing
I’m so glad you're here
I’m sick to death
I’m scared I’m gonna see
I’m scared
I’m really, really tired
I’m really loving you
I’m ready to sing
I’m ready for this
I’m pretty
I’m out of everything
I’m once again wrong
I’m on the move
I’m old
I’m okay with it
I’m of the future
I’m not your boss
I’m not so sure
I’m not looking through the day
I’m not doing it for her
I’m not crying
I’m not crazy
I’m not all wrong
I’m never going to pick up my shoes
I’m never going nowhere
I’m naked inside
I’m moving too slowly
I’m mine
I’m meant to be
I’m making music
I’m making it so easy
I’m looking to move tomorrow
I’m looking at you
I’m lonely
I’m locked up
I’m locked in
I’m leaving it at home
I’m leaving
I’m keeping you
I’m just wearing my bare feet
I’m just turning my corner
I’m just taking your life away
I’m just getting more
I’m inside
I’m impatient
I’m home
I’m here to take you apart
I’m here to stay
I’m here to say
I’m here to help
I’m here so suddenly
I’m here
I’m happy
I’m got a vision
I’m gonna stay
I’m gonna ruin your life
I’m gonna quit
I’m gonna join
I’m gonna find my tomb
I’m gonna die
I’m gonna break out tonight
I’m gonna be home
I’m going to live like nobody knows
I’m going to give you a crack
I’m going to be so sick
I’m going nowhere
I’m glad they’re gone
I’m giving away something to anyone
I’m getting old
I’m getting jealous
I’m getting high
I’m getting great at painting
I’m getting down
I’m getting colder
I’m getting close
I’m fucking alone
I’m forgetting everything
I’m floating down
I’m fine with the fleshy paper
I’m fine with it
I’m fine
I’m finally awake
I’m feeling tired
I’m feeling sorry for you
I’m feeling good
I’m dying of envy
I’m done with them
I’m doing nothing
I’m coming so far
I’m cold and lonely
I’m changing a life
I’m busy restlessly
I’m busy getting here
I’m blind
I’m beyond attraction
I’m at home
I’m an old man
I’m an electric driver
I’m always on you
I’m always like this
I’m always late
I’m always cold
I’m alone
I’m almost done
I’m almost awake
I’m all things to get
I’m alive in front of the mirror
I’m alive
I’m about to set down
I’m about to dive in
I’m about to catch my breath
I’m a walking dead
I’m a little sickened
I’m a hero
I’m a busybody
I’m a boy
I’m a bit uneasy
I’ll use them to change my mind
I’ll throw you away
I’ll throw them the punch
I’ll start another job
I’ll show you what it means
I’ll see you when I grow up
I’ll put you to sleep
I’ll put you on your ass
I’ll pray for your soft affections
I’ll pass
I’ll not keep my head out of the water
I’ll never touch it
I’ll never stay, forever
I’ll never stay
I’ll never meet you
I’ll never look my best again
I’ll never find love
I’ll never find
I’ll never be satisfied
I’ll need you to be
I’ll move on
I’ll lose you
I’ll live in his statue
I’ll kick your ass a thousand times
I’ll keep shooting
I’ll just ask why
I’ll have to be a liar
I’ll go in my father's shadow
I’ll give you something
I’ll give you peace
I’ll get you something
I’ll find you
I’ll find out
I’ll fill your space
I’ll drown in you
I’ll cry out loud
I’ll burn your eyes
I’ll be your mother
I’ll be tomorrow
I’ll be sober
I’ll be so damn tired
I’ll be sick
I’ll be okay
I’ll be in prison
I’ll be glad I don’t go now
I’ll be fine and right
I’ll be cool
I’ll be by you
I’ll be alive every day
I’ll be able to
I’ll be a pig
I’ll always be my lover
It’s your record
It’s your mouth
It’s wonderful
It’s what I’ve been through
It’s unmade
It’s true
It’s tough on her
It’s too late
It’s time to lay down
It’s time to go home
It’s time for you
It’s time for the stable
It’s time for the moon
It’s time for the great game
It’s still you and me
It’s some nostalgia joke
It’s so easy
It’s ridiculous
It’s really not fair
It’s out of habit
It’s only fair
It’s one of the biggest lies
It’s okay to make mistakes
It’s okay
It’s not your fault
It’s not wrong
It’s not worth it
It’s not my night
It’s not like you've ever seen me
It’s not like that’s right
It’s not a good thing
It’s nice to be around you
It’s nice to be around
It’s my son
It’s my dream
It’s just plain terrible
It’s just me
It’s just like me
It’s just down the line
It’s illegal
It’s his pleasure
It’s hard to name
It’s hard to hide
It’s hard to finish
It’s half men
It’s getting late
It’s fucking alive
It’s fucked up
It’s fine
It’s easy to roll in love
It’s crazy how bad it gets
It’s cold here
It’s boring
It’s been going on forever
It’s beautiful
It’s bad enough
It’s awful
It’s as if the world has no end
It’s an idol
It’s an act
It’s an acrid day
It’s almost time for a Christmas tree
It’s almost endless
It’s all wonderful
It’s all life or nothing
It’s all his fault
It’s all about them
It’s all about fear
It’s about here
It’s a prison
It’s a pretty girl in a dirty hotel
It’s a merry dance
It’s a little bit less than here
It’s a kind of beast
It’s a girl
It’s a duel
It’s a crime
It’s a corner
It’s a cliché
Its a hell of a fight
It's the Devil
It's so heavenly
It's so hard
It's slow for you
It's probably so cold now
It's pretty too good to be true
It's over now
It's obvious
It's not…it’s not right
It's never good
It's mine
It's like leaving you alone
It's like a train of sickle pals
It's just way over your head
It's hard to find
It's gonna stay with you
It's going to be awful
It's getting cold up in the morning
It's fucking violent
It's easier to be a light
It's cold here
It's all you
It's a good place
It won't take long to sing
It will make you think
It will grow at the top
It will bring out the devil
It wasn't a dream
It was written in sorrow
It was the night before
It was so true
It was only natural
It was off to the races
It was never mine
It was like I had been shooting
It was just yesterday
It was a pain to bear
It took me years to lose
It took me from living out with my mind
It took her by surprise
It takes him down
It takes a village
It shouldn't be so much like that
It really hurts me
It never leaves me
It makes my skin feel warm
It makes me so lonely
It looks like I’ve arrived
It keeps your hot lips from looking wild
It just happened
It is such a waste of time
It is over
It is called earth
It is broken
It is all behind you
It had come with it
It gets you down
It feels so nice
It feels like a dream
It didn't look like you’re there
It could be a vice
It came out his skin and talked to me
It brings a smile
It ain't wrong
It ain't looking good
It ain't hard enough
Isn't this just a game show
Isn't the only thing that matters
Isn't she going to make it this way?
Isn't it black?
Isn't it better for everybody to be safe?
Is this brother an enemy of mine?
Is this all just silly?
Is this a dream?
Is the thing without you here?
Is that it?
Is not the right way
Is it running here?
Is it okay to be where you are
Is it okay if it just keeps saying so?
Is it for you?
Is he starting to catch fire?
Is he free?
Is gonna be rain by the boat
Is everything good?
Is everybody doing it?
Is everybody crying?
Is buried far away
Irritating dreamers
Irony
Iron on the silver line
Iron hangs on shelves
Iron hands, ghost of a dream
Iron hand now
Iron food
Iron and steel
Invite your family
Invented
Invent the new fable
Invades the halls
Intrigue of innocence
Into your cup of tea
Into this world
Into the truth
Into the lonely water
Into the jungle
Into the human world
Into the hearts of men
Into the glow
Into the dark
Into the chaos
Into silence
Into it
Into an empty scene
Into a world that was only outside
Interminable mental play
Interlude after another day
Intergalactic relations
Inter-generational timeframe
Intense pleasure
Intense emotion
Instinctive devotions
Instead of breaking, beat, bend
Instant and dying
Inspiring all your life
Inspire you
Inspiration, revelation
Inspiration in the sky
Inspiration flying through your veins
Inside the sanctum sanctorum
Inside the dream
Inside the box
Inside of you
Inside my heart
Inside locked out
Inside a moth
Inside I fear
Inherited by fate
Infiltrate you
Incoming powerful waves
Incentive shows
Inaing indecision
In your youth
In your stomach
In your sadness
In your place
In your mind
In your heart
In your blood now
In white?
In truth
In true dance
In time
In this windy time
In this sandpit place
In this room
In this day and age
In there
In their blood and sweat
In the time when I was unearthly
In the thick of the day
In the test case
In the ten-cent battle
In the sunlight
In the street
In the snow
In the shadow of the ring
In the same room
In the safety of the Holy Grail
In the room
In the present
In the open you must be a guest
In the only space between men
In the new space
In the narrow courtyard
In the moments of contempt
In the minds of the law
In the midst of suffering
In the midst of her glory
In the middle of the desert
In the land of snakes
In the interest of playing along
In the interest of my son
In the interest of full harmony
In the hospital
In the high air
In the heart of the city
In the ground
In the gate
In the game of life
In the form of a split second
In the fog
In the fields
In the evening
In the depths
In the dark
In the crossroads
In the bottom of the sea
In the book
In the band
In tears
In such a big way
In song
In shackled words
In ruins
In our shame
In our battle-lines
In order to remain sane
In my ways
In my shoes
In my opinion
In my head
In my dream
In my care
In most of the books
In love with a person
In love
In jail cell
In it we run, walking distance
In it I came
In isolation
In hope we will burn in hell
In honour of the past
In his rage
In his passing
In his anger
In her way
In her stormy New York days
In heaven
In glory
In every pose
In darkness
In between our lines
In another world
In and out
In an all-inclusive chapter
In all the glory of his face
In a thousand different ways
In a secret corner
In a room with a bar
In a lost tongue
In a hurry
In a foreign land
In a flash
In a dream
In a clear room
In a bubble
In a big room
Imprint the planet
Impress her
Immortal
Immolate yourself
Immediate triumph
Imagine the shock
Imagine my eyes
Im with you
Im tired of staying where I am
Im not sure who to look for
Im a idiot
If you’re still all alive
If you’re bringing me through
If you’re bringing it home
If you wish
If you were breathing
If you want to know
If you want a slice of the night
If you think you are
If you survive this phase
If you stayed here
If you seem like me
If you scream and cry as I say
If you meet me for love
If you have
If you grow up with art
If you get sick of me
If you don’t want to take advantage
If you don’t like it
If you don't care for me
If you could all pass
If you cast me on the wings
If you can never get lost
If we were angels
If we used her
If we all die
If they’re looking forward
If the sun shines on me
If the spirits of the dying could stand at my feet
If the mice still live inside
If the cloud
If she tried on his clothes
If only you had died
If only you could see
If only there were a trade
If my money can't feed me
If it’s fucking broken
If it’s a miracle
If it’s Sunday morning
If it takes you some more time
If it could love you
If he ever flew
If he brings it back tomorrow
If anyone did
If I’ve never worked
If I walked it in
If I die tomorrow
If I can keep you
Ice cream from the top
Ice cream and kiss you
Ice across the sky
I've seen no reason to think
I've made your pretty name?
I've lost all respect for you
I've got something
I've got so many sights on me
I've got no time for it
I'm well, but stay away
I'm watching my lover sleep
I'm tired
I'm supposed to move heaven
I'm still afraid
I'm sorry
I'm so wrong
I'm so worried
I'm so sorry
I'm right beside you
I'm outta here
I'm on top
I'm not satisfied
I'm not going to do it right here
I'm not even comfortable
I'm not even a job
I'm not crying
I'm lying
I'm looking right at you
I'm just stuck behind
I'm hungry
I'm home tonight
I'm hearing your voice
I'm having the time of my life
I'm gonna kill you
I'm gonna be tomorrow
I'm going to meet you
I'm going to kick the butt
I'm going out for a dance
I'm getting tired
I'm free
I'm fine with it
I'm feeling so good
I'm feeling so fucking hungry
I'm dying
I'm doing it wrong
I'm coming home
I'm coming back tomorrow
I'm close to dying
I'm away
I'm almost feeling the beat
I'm almost at the start
I'm afraid you’ll take me
I'm afraid she’d go
I'm afraid of this world
I'm a shame
I'm a savior
I'm a bird
I'll use your friends
I'll understand
I'll take a girl if she calls you
I'll stay a while longer
I'll play some good games
I'll never make you pay
I'll miss you
I'll kill you
I'll introduce you
I'll go to the bathroom
I'll go outside
I'll go and beat you down
I'll get into it with a beat
I'll feel so comfortable
I'll do the same for you
I'll die by your hand
I'll be there every day
I'd try to become Miss America
I'd never lose it
I ’m not afraid to die
I ’m driving away from you
I would have wanted
I won’t touch
I won’t tell
I won’t take credit
I won’t look on you
I won’t go
I won’t die in vain
I won’t cry out
I wonder why
I wonder what’s on my mind?
I wonder what?
I wonder what lives in that hell?
I wonder the future
I wonder how?
I wonder how many bars there are?
I won't feel the pain anymore
I won't feel good
I won't blame you for anything
I wish you were here
I will take care of you
I will stay on them
I will show you where it feels right
I will shake
I will serve you
I will see
I will ruin this music
I will return
I will pass this point
I will pass away
I will not forget
I will never stop
I will move inside
I will move forwards
I will keep you
I will feel
I will beat you on the ass
I will be your role model
I will be you
I will be sorry
I will be forever
I will be fine
I will always be there
I went to sleep watching
I went home
I went down
I wasn't thinking for six weeks
I wasn't dead
I was tired of thinking
I was so fucked with fucking power
I was right
I was one time
I was of glass
I was new to the job
I was going to hell
I was going through all these shows
I was born to pass my time
I was born to ask you
I was born into the curse
I was afraid of him
I wanted you to keep quiet
I wanted to cry
I want you to love me
I want you to be my friend
I want you there
I want you all to think about
I want you
I want to stay in this town
I want to see you now
I want to kill you
I want to go home
I want to change everything
I want to be golden
I want the world to know
I want something from you
I want my mind to wander
I want her lovingly taken away
I wanna show you how
I wanna see
I wanna kill you
I wanna go alive
I wanna feel okay
I wanna eat your trash
I walked down this road
I walked away
I walk past you
I walk
I used to tell her so
I used to stay out of sight
I used to hang around here
I use my voice
I use a coffin
I turned up to meet you
I took your sword
I took you
I took pity from you
I took out my mitts
I took him to war
I thought you were dead
I thought you were
I thought she didn't exist
I thought it was poison
I thought it was Jesus
I thought I was going to die
I think you’re well?
I think you have another hand
I think you don’t belong here
I think that could be cool
I think someone laid down
I think she's got a soul
I think my own problems
I think it's time to go?
I think it is all good
I think he’ll tell me
I think he says it's for your cup of tea
I think I’ve been getting kicked
I think I'm gonna be okay
I think I was alone
I think I need sex
I think I just sank
I think I am
I think
I tell you what to believe
I tell you
I take your hand
I take you down
I take all of my notes
I take a fall
I still talk at night
I still have dreams
I still got it
I still feel pity
I still don’t have the holy order
I still can’t seem to look at it
I started out as you do
I sing the blues
I should try
I should get some friends in my band
I should feel free
I shall move from him
I see you’re a wise man
I see you shine
I see you instead
I see you alright
I see through your window
I see through all of your sorrow
I see no enemy
I see her hands on my shoulder
I see a silver lining
I say, I want to know
I say you don't show
I say to myself that we’re all friends
I say don't keep out
I say I can put away all that sadness
I saw you through
I saw you get ready
I saw the world
I saw the power behind you
I saw she led me inside
I saw my mother
I saw it for weeks
I saw a sunrise
I saw a book’s starting to come out
I sat alone
I remember this dream
I owe your money
I owe you nothing
I only watch you naked
I only see you once
I only care where I am from
I never understood the blindness
I never took that road
I never thought of it so
I never talked to the boy
I never spoke to you
I never saw you like this before
I never know who you are
I never know
I never knew him
I never got a chance
I never gave you a chance
I never did it right
I need you’ve built me a secret dream
I need your help
I need you to do this
I need you
I need to close the window
I need the things
I need somebody to love
I must make her feel good
I missed you
I miss you
I met his father
I mean what is on your mind
I mean to tell you a secret
I mean these things
I mean the time and place
I mean my name is again
I mean all of us
I may make you feel bad
I make mistakes
I made myself home
I made a friend out
I loved you
I love you, sweetie
I love you too
I love you so much
I love you like I love myself
I love you forever
I love making mistakes
I love it so much
I love it
I love him
I lost my sight
I looked it up
I looked down on my troubled youth
I looked down into the deep ocean
I looked at you’ve never seen
I lived a nightmare
I like it too
I like it cold
I know, I love you
I know you’ve seen
I know you’re me
I know you’re fine
I know your dreams
I know where this artist is at
I know where I'm at
I know when I can’t tell
I know what you mean
I know what my name is
I know that
I know she’d not
I know she said
I know now
I know my life is over
I know it’s you
I know it’s got nothing to do
I know it’s evening
I know it was the last time
I know everything
I knew you’d come
I knew she was mine
I knew he’d die
I knew
I kept her some distance
I kept going up
I keep your hand so close
I keep my life to myself
I keep growing
I keep going
I keep getting pleasure
I keep disappearing
I just want to watch the streetlights shift
I just wanna sleep
I just need a teacher
I just met her
I just love you
I just live in a bubble
I just get why
I just feel like I’m giving in
I just can't seem to get away
I just can't fucking do it
I just came for you
I hope you won’t care
I hope you stay right next door
I hope we'll be together soon
I hope she won't survive
I heard something strange
I hear you talk
I hear the singing
I have no trouble seeing
I have no new money
I have met my mother
I have been dying for so long
I have a secret soul
I have a crush
I hate my father
I hate it
I hate having to be alone
I had to take care of my business
I had to know
I had their accent
I had met him
I had been living
I had a dream the other day
I guess they had a clue
I guess so
I grew up watching you’re all right
I grew up on earth
I grew up in an echo
I grew up around being scared
I grew too old
I gotta shake my world apart
I gotta say that
I gotta make friends
I gotta finish him
I gotta be with you
I got to come with you
I got some pretty sick cutie mark
I got it going
I got a gourd
I get tired of watching you
I get it
I get around from where you got to
I gave it to you in the rain
I found you alive
I found something special
I found somebody safe
I found myself so satisfied
I found an way to get in
I fought like a devil
I find myself working
I find love
I fell for the mavens
I feel... my love
I feel you’re in danger
I feel the pressure of all the stars
I feel the need to tell you
I feel so broken
I feel so bad for you
I feel sick
I feel scarred
I feel rotten
I feel myself falling apart
I feel my own sweetness
I feel like nobody knows
I feel like it’s time to say goodbye
I feel like a band of crazy thugs
I feel like I’m being purged
I feel kinda bad because I didn't
I feel invincible
I feel hurt and bitter
I feel good
I feel fucked
I feel free
I feel down
I feel alive
I feel a burning sensation
I feel I’m doomed
I fear not
I do…
I don’t want your memory
I don’t want to stay here
I don’t want to be your friend
I don’t want to be you
I don’t want to be his friend
I don’t wanna be anybody else
I don’t understand why you’re dying
I don’t see why it is said?
I don’t see that coming
I don’t need you
I don’t need to watch it last forever
I don’t need it’s alright
I don’t mind it
I don’t mean to judge
I don’t love you
I don’t look pretty
I don’t know who I’m gonna belong to
I don’t know what else
I don’t know if you were good or evil
I don’t know
I don’t have my future
I don’t have much left to say
I don’t get it now
I don’t care where it’s headed
I don’t care what you say
I don’t care what he’s doing
I don’t care to be
I don’t care how old you are
I don't want you to lie
I don't want you to know
I don't want anyone else to know
I don't need you anymore
I don't like this
I don't like them
I don't know why you’ve done it?
I don't know why you are here
I don't know why
I do not know who you are
I do not hate you
I do feel better
I died for you
I died
I didn’t look so damn cute
I didn’t know what I was doing
I didn't want to say anything
I didn't need to be bothered
I didn't know what it was
I didn't dance
I didn't care about you
I did say that
I could teach you later
I could only laugh
I could make you be so good
I could go
I could get tired
I could feel you all around me
I could feel her tongue tingle
I come from such a place
I care about you
I can’t watch
I can’t wait to see you
I can’t wait till he’s gone
I can’t understand why
I can’t tell what to say
I can’t survive without you
I can’t say with any certainty
I can’t play jagged walls
I can’t let you go
I can’t hide behind
I can’t go on until they see
I can’t get used to my existence
I can’t control what I see
I can’t be shy
I cannot write this goodbye
I cannot wait to find out what you say
I cannot believe this
I cannot be seen
I can't take it anymore
I can't move
I can't help it
I can tell you how to kiss her
I can tell him shit
I can talk to you easily
I can see you’ve got you
I can see you turning
I can see you crying
I can see the sun shining
I can see the memories
I can see my guard out
I can see it now
I can never be good
I can look and feel
I can lay back
I can hold my own
I can help you
I can fly over the stars
I can feel you’re close to getting high
I can feel this tension
I can feel it stalking behind me
I can feel it rising
I can dance naked
I can burn ourselves up
I can be as much as I want
I can be an old man
I can barely move
I came to save you
I believe you
I believe that for some reason
I believe it but I ain't sure who
I believe it
I believe I’m making a mess
I am your spirit
I am wondering
I am strong
I am still in your ways
I am sorry, I need to get away
I am not happy
I am inside
I am here now
I am going nowhere
I am desperate to get out of here
I am awake
I am a broken statue
I am a big fan
I always took my kiss
I always got it wrong
Hurt you
Hurt my brother
Hurt his emotion
Hurt all the time
Hurt a girl
Hurt
Hurry and pick away
Hungry Sunday
Hunger, I’m a bubble
Human trafficking
Human intercourse
Human beings can do nothing but watch
Huddled before the fire
How you’ll find my home
How you’ll be
How you spoke
How well you're doing
How to survive on acid
How to make you feel
How to beat that teacher
How they were made
How the memory wore on me
How the fire is cooking
How soon will they fade
How she’d slip away
How much I hate you
How many times do I have to eat?
How lovely you can be
How long will you hold on to my love
How long will it take?
How it’s done
How is my day
How he always pretends he found her
How fucking nice you sound
How easy it seems
How easy it is
How do you say?
How do you know?
How did you know?
How did he get here?
How could you?
How could you know?
How could I possibly know
How could I possibly be apart
How could I be dead here?
How can you care?
How bad can it be?
How I'm looking for glory
How I see you
How I ride
How I had to sell my soul
How I grew up in America
How I feel whenever I feel dirty
Hound her
Hot master fuck
Hot lips
Horses roll around on a bed
Hoping to get on your feet
Hoping to die
Hoping to cross the stars
Hoping for the wind
Hoping for our sun to shine
Hoping for another day
Hopeless in search
Hope I'll be around to add some perspective
Hope I found a better place
Hooligans love me
Hooking on the stars
Hooked in love
Hook it up
Honey, yes
Honey wets a month
Honey
Homeward
Holy, this is so wrong
Holy virgin ocean
Holy trick
Holy shit
Holy men who’re dying
Holy it’s not holy it's clean’s straight
Holy gun
Holy chance
Holy blows in the style
Holds them down
Hold your tongue
Hold your seat
Hold your hand
Hold your breath
Hold on tight alrightie’s right
Hold my hands
Hold it together
Hold it close
Hold it and watch it flow
Hold down that pistol
Hit the wall
Hit the open flame
Hit me with a brick
Hit me up again
Hit a saint
His turn at last
His tears won't die
His sips of poison
His sandalwood is unhangin'
His office
His name is Anna
His naked body
His mouth is empty
His missing pocket
His mind went crazy
His messianic grandeur
His main feeder
His love’s fine
His look was fatal
His life's like a drug
His hand is moving
His hand in mine
His hair on the ground
His habit of asking me if I got a look
His guiding hand
His flesh overtakes his bones
His feet are getting stashed away
His false bravado
His face’s hidden away
His days are forever
His dark guilt
His body is under fire
His body appears so immovable
His arms are warm
His arms are tied in chains
Highway without my wand
Hightime has arrived
Higher-priority love
Higher with the sun
Higher in my price
High priestly pose
High on the mountain
High on the crappie
High in the morning
High and mighty
High above all
Hiding in plain sight
Hiding behind our hopes
Hiding
Hideaway
Hide your soul
Hide your braiding
Hide the pathetic lie
Hide in your wings
Hidden too hard
He’s the only guy to sleep
He’s taken my wallet
He’s smart too
He’s running away
He’s not gonna like it anymore
He’s never gone
He’s never a good excuse
He’s lost sight of me
He’s just another human being
He’s had enough of hatred
He’s good to go
He’s getting paid
He’s getting one of them
He’s fighting back
He’s broken
He’s brilliant
He’s being crazy
He’s around
He’s already been wrong
He’s already been awake in another dream
He’s all yours
He’s all I ever wanted
He’s alive
He’s a shock to behold
He’s a shark
He’s a lifeline
He’s a blank slate
He’ll know what you know
He’ll get a roll
He’ll fly
He’d take my life away
Heyyyy you at the food hall
Hey, you look good
Hey, what's that really like?
Hey, what are you doing?
Hey, nice view
Hey, look at me and dance
Hey, everyone right now
Hey watch the singing
Hey rain on fire
Hey momma
Hey man
Hey look out there
Hey look at me
Hey look at it
Hey let's make it stop
Hey go away
Hey daddy
Hey baby, what’s wrong?
Hey babe
Hey angel
Hey Mama
Here's your girl
Here's to you
Here's the place
Here's some news
Here you go again
Here you are
Here we go again
Here we go
Here we come to swallow
Here we are laugh
Here we are
Here tomorrow would be fine
Here to stay
Here to see my tomorrow
Here the skies fall
Here she is
Here she comes
Here it is, in your heart
Here is the vision
Here is my friend
Here in my side
Here in my city
Here in a world full of shadows
Here he comes
Here comes your talk
Here comes your big brother
Here comes the last story
Here comes the jealous
Here comes healing
Here at your place
Here I’m going to live again
Here I go new universe
Here I go again
Here I go
Here I come again
Here I come
Here I am
Her vision for new life
Her truck sashays her past
Her throne
Her roots are planted
Her parents flew around
Her new smoke time
Her miserable cry
Her mind is here
Her lungs go white
Her image comes on slowly
Her hair is thicker and rich red
Her eyes turned green
Her custom guy
Her boss is like a snake
Her body
Her beauty
Her band
Her bag
Her God-given style
Help us after this is all over
Help me if they're looking for it
Help me get out
Hello, there it is!
Hello universe
Hello there, hello there, honey baby
Hello real life
Hello from death
Hello for a date
Hello everyone
Hello darling
Hello
Hell isn't my soul
Hell and all’s fair
Heinz's lost his high
Heavy pressure
Heavy armor
Heaven will be under a row
Heaven for her
Heaven and earth are still moving
Heart's so sweet
Heart of my heart
Heart here
Heart bleeds
Heard the sound of my footsteps
Hear the sounds
Hear me, all the time
Hear me shout
Hear me scream
Hear me say
Hear me out
Hear it all over your shoulder
Hear her scream
Heady little kids
Headlights shine
Heading into somebody's life
Heading away
Headfirst here
Headed the bank
Headband worn over the hood
Head to the room
Head to the news
Head over heels
Head from the future
He's starting to quit
He's started to quit
He's not afraid
He's nice as pitchfork
He's never said another word
He's just trying to understand
He's inside me
He's got your eyes on him
He's got to win for her
He'll know you’re wrong
He'd be proud of it
He won't be soon
He wasn't a cop
He was taking notes
He was right
He wakes me up
He used his lonely desperation
He turned to the moon
He turned my bedroom into a casino
He told me
He threw it on me
He thought I was wrong
He sure looks like a hospital-girl
He sits in awe
He seems satisfied
He said tomorrow, yeah?
He said no
He rode all night
He rides away
He put the special stains on his arm
He put it away
He pushed a woman
He played me quite hard
He only a dream
He once gave it everything
He never said goodbye
He might look fine and soft
He may leave me alone
He made me sick
He made me love you
He loves her too
He loved you
He lost sight of the day
He looks around you
He looked like a picture
He lives your loneliness
He lied
He knows who
He knew I was right
He kept getting into my hair
He just finished painting
He is the father
He hung around in his little town
He has no need for words
He has a mistress
He got crazy
He goes to sleep
He gets from heartbreak
He doesze off
He dies for you
He died young
He died like you all day
He died a fat man
He cut inside
He couldn’t watch me
He could not help but shout
He comes through
He can't stop me
He can't seem to walk alone
He can't lose anymore
He calls me small
He became sick once again
He always pointed a camera on me
He always looked at me, made me watch
He always had a spare change
He (a wild beast) needs a name
He
Hazing
Have you ever met a golden girl?
Have the strength
Have some excuses
Have never seen the day
Have loved you
Have got a plan
Have become involved
Have all that oil and butter
Have a soul
Haunting me
Hated and saddled
Hate, pity, hatred
Hate up on me
Hate ties the hood
Hate so many things
Hate came my way
Has to push it in
Harsh with empathy
Hark up a while ago
Hard to leave
Hard times
Hard on your face
Hard on my head
Hard more like hell
Hard and slow
Happy, satisfied, bliss
Happy tomorrow
Happy drinking
Hanging over the pavement
Hanging on his head
Hanging in the mountains
Hanging in the bushes
Hang your hands together
Hang over me like a bat
Hang on!
Hang on to me
Hang it around
Hang in there and stick by me
Hang in there
Hands on walls
Hand-to-hand combat
Hand-cuffed before we move on
Hand me her sweet place
Hand me a pencil
Hand laid
Halt the world
Half of my living room
Half empty
Half blind
Half a dozen presidents
Hair
Haha
Had to surrender
Had the edge
Had no windows
Had no father
Had another title
Had a dream
Gully
Guilt won’t help you
Grows away
Grown up fast
Grown apart
Grow up to become a complete man
Grow up here
Grow up and grow old
Grow some bodies
Grow old
Grew up
Greeting me
Green waves
Green walls
Green plays shotgun
Green mountains below
Green light
Green here, yellow there
Green fire
Green beer at the breakaway
Greatness you owe me
Great western smoke
Great thoughts
Great songs
Great scale
Great save for your soul
Great pair
Great house
Great game
Great butler
Great beyond your being
Great Light
Grandma died as she sailed the sun
Grandfathered to the gang
Grabbing the freedom
Grabbing my money
Grab your heart
Grab up and wander
Grab a square
Goze right through my shit
Gotta send her home
Got up inside and ready for our son
Got to make my point
Got to finish it
Got the wrong sound
Got the weed up your arm
Got the phone tower
Got the green paint
Got some flowers to sell
Got sick of singing
Got past it
Got paper and a cup of tea
Got paid
Got on his face

Go to his place
Go to heaven
Go throw it off
Go through with you

Go honey, this way
Go head to head
Go for the highroad
Go drown on the face
Go down again
Go by my memory
Go back, I'm the rain king
Go back home
Go away
Go ahead and run
Go ahead and drop me
Glowing sparks
Glowing mist
Glowing in your eyes
Glowing from autumn
Glides down in his lap
Glass leaves water
Glass
Glamorous looks

Giving you a lifetime's worth

Gentlemen for a man
Gazing down as I go
Gave you all my success
Gave up already
Gave me my arm
Gave me grief
Gave it my all
Gave every move
Gather the truth
Gangway out of control
Future's key to victory
Future cargoes
Future
Fumbling through sentences
Fully blurred vision
Full of waste
Full of sorrow
Full of shit
Full of passion
Full of nonsense
Full of life
Full of gutter glue
Fucking stumbled across a lie
Fucking stare at me
Fucking send me home
Fucking say what?
Fucking rotten water
Fucking rock of the night
Fucking hangover
Fuckin down that road
Fuck that statue
Fuck it
Frosty black machine
From: Young Voices
From your mouth
From time to time
From thorns to watery eyes
From this place
From this knife to your feet
From the spinners
From the piece of me
From the pages of the old songs
From the ocean floor
From the mouth to the lips
From the mouth of a pig
From the garb of the night
From the empty little floor
From the depths
From street to gate
From our balconies
From now on
From my heart
From knowing the ancient fate
From just another substitute
From inside out
From here to nowhere
From hell
From death and mourning
From corruption and red flags
Friendship will fail
Friends with a free mind
Friends on the flowers
Friends and family
Friends I held
Fresh juice
Fresh from the grave
Freeing me and killing me
Freedom’s only opportunity
Freedom to act like I'm in a mine
Freedom room
Freedom of the will
Freedom of speech
Freedom no matter what we do
Freedom just won't let me die
Freedom from fear
Freedom feels so beautiful
Free your soul
Free me from my disappointments
Free and free
Freaks from outer space
Freaks don't understand
Freaking the wind
Freaking
Freakin' everybody he meets
Four winds, seven sides
Four planes
Four empty blue pills
Foundling
Foundered
Found you
Found these bags
Found something that interests me
Found paradise
Found fire from my fire
Found a roof
Fortunate to have won
Forgetting for a moment
Forget your wands
Forget your devotion
Forget that week
Forget everything
Forget any pleasure
Forget all the shades
Forget about a dream
Forever’s mine
Forever will be
Forever speechless
Forever running
Foreskin simpletons
For with love
For what’s good
For three days old
For three days
For this is your home
For the world
For the tips
For the man
For the infamy
For the dead wailing
For the better too
For the Italian goldfish
For ten thousand years
For some reason
For some I could hold
For once
For nothing
For my warm call
For my part
For miles along the highway
For making our call
For live silver
For just a moment
For his sins
For every bar you dance
For all this time
For all our deep grief
For all eternity
For ages
For a stroke of luck
For a reason in your mind
For a present
For a month there is weeping
For a day
Fools, idiots and bunnies
Fools you
Fools say you’re friends
Fools dream of success
Foolishness—what to me
Fooled or pleased
Followed by the others
Flying vinyl
Flying to the countryside
Flying to America
Flying through the sky
Flying the rainbow
Flying past home
Flying over the air
Flying on the horizon
Flying low
Flying dreams
Flying by a thousand sticks
Flying bridge
Flying a light sigh
Flying a balloon
Fly with red coat
Fly to your own memory
Fly to stars
Fly through the sky
Fly there's no hell
Fly on the sky
Fly low
Fly in this green cloud
Fly in one band
Fly him along
Fly from one crisis to the next
Fly down the street
Fly by force
Fly blind
Fly away and soar
Fly away
Fly all over the sky
Fly all over the city
Fly again
Fly a thousand miles
Flows from your head
Flown away by one sick old cannibal
Flowing water in your hand
Floating island
Floating in the sea
Floating in the air
Floating before the sun
Flashs of hell
Flashing through the streets
Flashing through a distorted mind
Flashing out the doors
Flash light
Flailing
Fix the darkness
Fix it up
Five to one
Fitted to live here
Fists of hay
First to take control
First time unpack
First time unheard of
First time over long ago
First time of summer
First time
First things first
First put on a wrong
First of all, let me show you the doors
First of all
First name from the tomb
First man in the world
First he saw me
First come, first served
First and only dreams
First and only chance
First I spent my life pursuing a mystery
Fireflies fly
Fireball
Fire within the span of time
Fire up your mind
Fire and fury
Fire and anger
Fire
Finesse
Finds room for her evil laughter
Finds my friends
Finding your own salvation
Finding my own destiny
Finders only deep inside yourself
Find your things
Find time
Find the truth
Find the children
Find something of value
Find some understanding
Find out how to stop it
Find it just the right way
Find him pretty
Find another way to die
Find another reason
Find a reason to fight
Find a prince
Finally, you look here
Finally liberty if you get back on stage
Finally here I come
Finally got a head start
Filled with milk
Filled with bitterness
Filled with Curses
Fill up and rattle
Fill him with cold tears
Fighting to get through
Fierce from the mouth
Felt wrong
Felt ready
Feeling your feet running
Feeling too quiet
Feeling the thunder in the sky
Feeling the sun ruin
Feeling so tired
Feeling sick
Feeling sad
Feeling pretty
Feeling powerful
Feeling like you only know
Feeling like a moth
Feeling chills
Feeling away
Feeling an affair with Jesus
Feeling abandoned
Feel yourself in the future
Feel the thrill of freedom
Feel the things within
Feel the line
Feel the lightpour
Feel the fire and weep
Feel so different
Feel myself afraid
Feel like the ant, someone said
Feel it in my eyes
Feel it grow empty
Feel good for a moment
Feel free to grow from me
Feel free to go
Feel free to eat
Feel free to cuss
Feel free
Feel for something
Feel bad for her
Feel at home
Feed the king
Fearsome little girl
Fear me when I grow old
Farewell to redefined cold depths
Far to go dead
Far in the future
Far from it
Far from free
Far from adrift
Far enough now
Far away is the wall
Far away and better than you know
Far apart
Fantastic world
Falling rain
Falling over
Falling into darkness
Falling in love
Falling for you
Falling down
Falling asleep is hard
Falling asleep in your arms
Falling apart
Fallen in love
Fallen angels
Fall off the planet
Fall in love
Fall down
Fake things
Fake stories
Fading through dreams
Fades out
Face in a bottle
Eyes wide open
Eyes wide and tired
Eyes that are kinder than snow
Eyes open and pure and what is there of me
Eyes on the floor
Eyes on her lips
Eyes of ravens
Eyes in the hills
Eyes belong to me
Extremely satisfied
Expose each other
Explain why you are a bad dancer
Explain to us
Explain that you are everywhere
Explain it to me
Explain everything
Exorcism
Exorcise death
Exhaling for the flesh
Excuse me?
Excuse me but I’m doing it wrong
Exclaiming ourselves
Exclaim the sky
Excessive force
Excessive drinking
Excerpted from one star in the sky
Examine you
Evil that keeps the city still
Evil in your eyes
Evil feeling
Evil control freak
Evil Angel
Everytime
Everything you've been told
Everything you need to know
Everything you have known
Everything up my sleeve
Everything she had before
Everything seems fine
Everything of good and evil
Everything looks awful
Everything is yours
Everything is in place
Everything in your hands
Everything good you are right now
Everything breaks
Everything I've been through
Everything I got
Everyone's dying
Everyone said you were
Everyone listens
Everyone knows
Everyone else's ring
Everyone else inside
Everyone I know
Everyday life is empty
Everyday I’m a lonely one
Everybody’s wondering?
Everybody’s so perfect
Everybody’s laughing
Everybody’s doing alright
Everybody’s alive
Everybody's missing your face
Everybody wants to ride
Everybody says
Everybody said we did it wrong
Everybody must love
Everybody knows, dance to a tune
Everybody knows it’s the same
Everybody in the town
Everybody gets their own way
Everybody from inside
Everybody finds their feet
Everybody feels down
Everybody else’s home
Everybody else will want to catch up
Everybody else on the moon
Everybody around me
Everybody and his fucking brother
Everybody I know’s watching
Every wound dies
Every wave of the sun
Every time I read
Every time I do
Every time
Every thing I did
Every thing
Every place I’m gone
Every penny
Every moment made me believe
Every minute
Every memory gets improved
Every little thing
Every indecision comes nearer
Every gun
Every friend of mine
Every final shot
Every fallen branch
Every dream is a nightmare
Every dream comes true
Every day my soul is weeping
Every day I hide
Every day I am awake
Every day
Every country in heaven
Every bit of it
Ever sorry
Ever since she came to you
Ever looking for your way
Ever keep on keeping up
Ever got lost
Ever forget your names
Even the fan has a mouth
Even pendant and dog
Even if the gave
Even deep in the tunnels
Even dance backwards
Even as I'm dying
Eternal sunset
Escape-scene
Escape the world
Erecting a pitiful creation
Erasing bloodlines
Erased the title
Envision a beautiful world
Entitled
Entire nation is already dead
Enter
Entangling me in the sand
Entangling himself
Entangled in an endless chain
Enough the golden harp
Enough pain in your bones
Enough of fame
Enough is enough
Enough for them to hate
Enduring every terror
End the mission
End of process
End my life
Enclosing doors
Enablers
Empty in your hand
Empty evil
Emptiness
Emotions can't wash
Emotions are moving so fast
Emotionally great
Embrace kindness
Elevate a stage
Either we sing or die
Either move or die
Either another mile walk
Eat the tears I'm taking
Eat me alive
Easy to reach
Easy
Eager to meet the cat
Eager to catch someone else
Each song
Each of us is a part of our story
Each building comes full steam ahead
Dying only to go
Dying now
Dying alone
Dust-filled town
Dust your shit down
Dust the lighter I wish
Dust the earth
During the offseason
During the month before Christmas
During the last dance
Dump me’s head
Dumb music
Dry spell
Drowning all your dreams
Drowned in cold water
Drown the palette
Dropping
Droping bells
Drop the worst of your silly ways
Drop the Candy
Drop our love
Drop off
Drop it and pass it
Drop down
Drop dead slow
Drop all your crap
Driving on the earth
Driving in the cold
Drive’s filled
Driven into a rage
Drive me back
Drinking rainbows
Drinking in this world
Drinking here
Drink's on my mind
Drink what you can
Drink their vodka
Drink the water
Drink the good news
Drink the ashes and pour the dew
Drink nothing but bleach
Drink all you want
Drifting mind
Dressing, or in a wheelchair?
Dressed up for the night
Dreams too extreme
Dreams became permanent
Dreams are worth living
Dreams are broken
Dreams and dream visions
Dreaming of someday
Dreaming of savagery
Dreaming of disaster
Dreaming of changing my words
Dreaming
Dreamers of tomorrow
Dream together
Dream through the day
Dream our big name
Dream of me
Dream it out
Dream is over
Dream about the shore
Dream about going down
Drawn my senses
Drawn a picture
Drawing electric
Downstairs, upstairs
Downstairs watching you face the world
Downright fun
Downing the ceiling
Downed the river
Down with your filth
Down with your butter-swinging leads
Down with the split china
Down with the outside world
Down with sun
Down with sadness
Down with all the noise
Down with all my passions
Down with abuse
Down with a revolution
Down under the land of hollies
Down to the rest
Down to our feet
Down to earth images
Down through the eyes of a dying fool
Down the road
Down the ages
Down that dance floor
Down out on the warm streets
Down in your own world
Down in winter
Down in this park
Down in the room
Down in the pool
Down in the frozen cemetery
Down in the basement
Down in darkness
Down in Washington
Down here
Down down your arm
Down by law
Down at the truth
Down at the beach
Down as an addict
Down a path
Doppelganger
Don’t you want me?
Don’t you feel the force of tomorrow
Don’t you care?
Don’t you agree?
Don’t wear your skirt
Don’t waste your time
Don’t wanna try
Don’t waltz out
Don’t walk like that
Don’t walk in the same room
Don’t try to get away
Don’t trust me
Don’t treat me like something else
Don’t take up your morning
Don’t stay
Don’t stare at you
Don’t spare her memories
Don’t sleep
Don’t rush me around
Don’t need my help
Don’t mind me, come on
Don’t mind me
Don’t mind if I remain

Don’t make any mistakes
Don’t lose sight of what we all stand on
Don’t look down
Don’t look at me like that
Don’t like crying
Don’t let up
Don’t let him see
Don’t leave me alone

Don’t know when
Don’t hurt me

Don’t have to feel bad about it
Don’t have it hard
Don’t have faith
Don’t grow up
Don’t forget your cardigan
Don’t forget me
Don’t forget it
Don’t forget
Don’t feel like dying
Don’t expect to move so easily
Don’t dream of this
Don’t die
Don’t cry for a minute
Don’t cry
Don’t come back here
Don’t care
Don’t call me old-fashioned
Don’t bother until the present day
Don’t believe in me
Don’t be king
Don’t be afraid to call me
Don’t be afraid
Don’t attack me
Don’t ask for anything
Don't you want to be here?
Don't turn me down
Don't touch it
Don't piss me off
Don't make me cry
Don't lose me
Don't let the space kiddos win
Don't laugh at me
Don't hurt him too much
Don't give me the bed
Don't get me wrong
Don't force you
Don't feel bad about it
Don't change a thing
Don't catch me like I'm not here
Don't cast it off in me
Don't call me jealous
Don't bring us down
Don't be so impatient
Doing your own thing
Doing your best to please
Doing so is all over
Dogshit
Dogma
Dogeared on the shore
Doesn't really work yet
Doesn't matter who wins
Doesn't matter what you say
Doesn't look like my heart
Doesn't get much worse
Does this look like me?
Does not sound right to you
Does it look weird?
Do you think you will ever come?
Do you think I am wrong
Do you see me?
Do you need me now?
Do you need it?
Do you like to play?
Do you know where we’ll be tomorrow?
Do you know where I am?
Do you know me?
Do you know how to take it from me
Do you care?
Do what you must
Do what you can
Do the right thing
Do the dishes
Do something you didn't mean to do
Do something like that
Do something
Do not be insincere
Do it together
Diving in title: While I grow older
Disturbing our shyness
Distractions
Distortion
Distilled down her heart
Distant thought
Distant I guess
Displays the veil
Dismissed man’s beliefs
Dismembering me
Dismantling the weeds
Disillusionment
Disguised him
Discovered your baby
Disconnect them all
Disciples of the fiery skies
Disapprove me
Disappoint me
Disappeared
Disagree with my opinions
Dirty until I clear my secret
Dirty trick king
Dirty the powder
Dirty guest
Dirty dreams are turned upside down
Dirty dishes
Dirt tracks
Dirt on the ground
Dirt got cleaned
Dirt from home
Directs myself from behind
Diner at the devil's table
Dilemma here
Digital footprints
Dig them back up
Dig more into my womb
Dig another hole
Different strands of meat
Different sorts of dreams
Different son of a bitch
Different numbers
Different love
Different colour palette
Died of a wound
Died in a pit of infamy
Died for the time
Die more slowly
Die before me
Die
Didn’t touch you
Didn’t move my hair
Didn’t mean it
Didn’t know
Didn't you notice me?
Didn't you know you were coming all the way?
Didn't you know that?
Didn't want to make your heart throw
Didn't move your game
Didn't feel so bad about it
Didn't change
Did you watch pornstars when you were young?
Did you know?
Did I hurt you?
Dibbing my heart
Devil for your money
Determination is my strength
Destroying the truth
Destroying a tune
Destroy your enemy
Destroy my soul
Desperate times
Desire to get laid
Depends on your timing
Depends on how you feel
Degenerative wealth
Deep within you
Deep within my soul
Deep white sea
Deep sleep
Deep inside tonight
Deep inside my heart
Deep inside
Deep dreams are held
Deemed the love of my life
Decent way to go
Deceive you
Death of the unborn
Death of a gentleman
Death in his form
Death does fear you
Death by chance
Dealt your heart
Deaf heartsets
Deadbeat into a frenzy
Dead paper tiger
Dead or alive
Dead on end
Dead men breathe
Dead men and sea children
Dead in the streets
Dead giveth someone a reason
Dead bird
Dead after all
Day passes
Day after day
Dawning news
Darkness inside
Darkness in the night
Darkest journey
Dark themes
Dark streets you dragged through
Dark smoke
Dark rain
Dark clouds seem insomniac
Dark clouds parted
Dancing with the devil
Dancing with music
Dancing together
Dancing to the beat of your own drum
Dancing through the gloom
Dancing stock footage
Dancing like music
Dancing from the roof
Dancing below
Dancing around like it’s forever
Dancing alive
Dancing a fine tune
Dance with angels
Dance to the tune of your heart
Dance out your exclamation
Dance of horns
Dance and dance
Dance
Damn, this is how you paint a story
Damages of record
Damaged memories
Damaged friends
Damage that fades and more
Dainty game
Cutting through the lines
Cutting through haze
Cutting into the heart
Cutting and going through with it
Cute dust
Cut-off end
Cut you off and drag your arms around
Cut up in your hands
Cut through all the dryers
Cut me a train
Cut it out of the sunshine
Cut down the trees
Curtain spouts
Curtain shrieking mirror
Curse, bury, come down on stage
Cupid's thousand doos
Crying too loud
Crying pills
Crying now
Crying my name
Crying in fear
Crying and weeping for the cross
Crying all the time
Crying all night
Crying against time
Cryin'
Cry to the cop
Cry in the shade
Cry before the gods
Cry as I dance
Cry all right
Cry Caroline
Crushing his throne
Crumbling down
Cruel red country
Crude price
Crude inside
Crude free unmade
Crude and caustic
Crucify it
Crossing the waters
Crossing the country
Crossing a line
Crooked tramp
Cried before
Crashing through your mind
Crashing through the night
Crashing at night
Crashing apart in my body
Crashes his face
Crap that clings
Cracking out the first wave
Covered in mud
Cover your eyes
Cover your ears
Cover with a wet velvet rope
Cover up the roads
Cover the storm
Cover the frame
Cover me with tape
Cover me
Cover
Couldn’t beat this song
Couldn't survive the warning
Couldn't have done this
Couldn't ever lay it down
Could not find the time to go to work
Could be you’re madder than hate
Cool; you’re trying your best together
Cool that mind control train
Cool sailing
Cool out and remind us
Cool fellas with names
Cool
Convinced we're done
Convinced that I'd follow them
Convinced I couldn’t look on
Connecting in my mind
Confusion
Confusing your fantasy
Confused, desperate
Confused
Confrontation
Confessions
Concoct one thing and pass it off as art
Comrade sheriff
Completely in pain
Complete
Common enemy
Common cause
Committed suicide
Cominning-glass
Coming here’s nothing but pride
Coming here now
Coming from within
Coming from heaven
Comin' together
Comfortable in the mouth
Come, come, come, come into that rush?
Come together
Come to this place
Come to ruin
Come to finish this sorrow
Come to a crossroads
Come out and just lay there
Come on, come on
Come on, boy
Come on!
Come on you
Come on sweetie
Come on pupils
Come on over
Come on now, that leaves the room
Come on ladies
Come on in the darkness
Come on in
Come on honey
Come on down the road
Come on down in a door
Come on down
Come on behind me
Come late
Come inside me
Come in there to dance
Come in the wind
Come in and I will sleep
Come here, knock on my door
Come for me
Come down to the fiery sea
Come down all alone
Come at me
Come and show
Come and go
Come aboard our dead planes
Colours change direction
Colors fade
Colors changing
Coloring there
Coldness taunts them
Cold take the water
Cold steel
Cold hearted heart
Cold blooded secrets
Closest place to a burning bush

Close the book
Close my eyes
Clones out his wings
Climbing the tree
Climbing into the sky
Climbing in heaven
Climb up
Climb the ladder
Climb on top of my head
Climb a wall
Click on a wall
Clear the sky
Clear my mind
Clear love for ourselves
Clear line up
Clear hair
Clear
Cleaned up shit
City control
Chump me
Checkmate with you
Checking your goddamn day
Checking down
Check your cupboard
Check to see who can show up
Check the rules
Check the roll of your eyes
Check out the snow
Check it out
Chasing you down
Chasing you
Chasing this high name
Chasing the moon
Chasing the brightness
Chasing me
Chasing into fire
Chasing interest
Chasing and beating
Chasing an ever-increasing appeal
Changing your mind
Changing the wash
Changing my mind
Changing colours
Changes what we know
Changes to your voice
Changes matter less
Change your method
Change the past
Change the eyes
Change the brightness
Change me
Change an attitude
Change
Celebrate the hopelessness
Celebrate our King
Cause this alone
Cause nothing can be done
Cause it’s okay
Cause I know your words
Caught up in the crowd
Caught up in a spinning haze
Caught up in a misunderstanding
Caught the fire
Caught staring at me
Caught our money
Caught on video
Caught keeping your heart cracked
Caught in this time
Caught in a trap
Caught as a shadow
Catch yourself in your mind
Catch your hand
Catch your face
Catch up
Catch the street’s lights
Cast your biggest test
Cast the same pattern as we did
Cast out the darkness
Cast me as your foreign enemy
Cast her memories in your heart
Cast a shadow
Carrying the king
Carrying the enemy out
Careless heh
Carefully to see the truth
Carefully thinking about tomorrow
Carefully and gently
Care to play this song
Care to feel your own?
Care for your money
Can’t you feel the pressure
Can’t stay neutral
Can’t seem to change
Can’t pay attention
Can’t leave your own stalker
Can’t have you know
Can’t do it tonight
Can’t do it anymore
Candyman’s face
Candy
Can't you just be as sweet as she says
Can't stay in our place
Can't seem to get over
Can't see you again
Can't hide
Can't help but cry
Can't hear me do it
Can't get upset
Can't get enough
Can't find our nose
Can't fight truth
Can't face you
Can't cry
Can't be bothered with that
Can you tie me to a chair
Can you see?
Can you see it?
Can you see it through
Can you reach the gate?
Can you find me?
Can you find an ad?
Can you even put on that monologue
Can we come together?
Can see right through it
Can see my reflection
Can only be sold by famous people
Can no one stop me?
Can hear my silhouette
Can go to heaven
Can come next time
Can be the sweet side
Can anyone relate
Can I stay home?
Can I see?
Can I reach you inside?
Can I help you?
Can I have a friend?
Can I feel your heart beating
Can I feel it now?
Came straight down
Came on, come on
Came into my body
Came as a merry man
Calm the sky
Calm down now
Calm down
Calling to his face
Calling the age out
Calling myself the brokenhearted
Calling him a monster
Calling for peace
Calling for it
Called your child
Called her name
Called for help
Called all your fairy tales
Call to arms
Call me weak
Call me the madman
Call me new
Call me home
Call me cool
By the waves
By the star towers
By the hand
By the age of forty-five
By killing you
Butts and paninis
But, won't you know that I gave you this?
But you’re my girl
But you’re mine
But you’re just there to be
But you’ll show
But you’ll go
But you’ll find me in the world
But your suit is leather
But you still took it from me
But you should stop kissing me
But you know it doesn't matter
But you have nothing
But you don’t go out here
But you can fly by your side
But why not
But where do you get the government money?
But where do I go?
But when it rains
But what if your body was naked?
But what does the world look like?
But we still have a little to do
But this is its own story
But they’re all safely parted
But they don’t want to know
But there’s nothing you can do
But there's no such thing
But there was hope
But there ain't room to move
But then she passed out
But then it hit me
But then again
But the sky
But the nails that hang on my own knees
But the hand is weeping
But the darkness’s a blot
But some won’t pay
But on the other hand
But look at you
But life's a trap
But just within the next two minutes
But it’s so damn hard
But it’s dying
But it was the first time we all talked
But instead we all look down on you
But if you’re right
But how you got there
But here I am
But for a change
But don’t let you at all
But beware all the evils
But before this fading sunlight
But all it took was a little fella singing
But all I see is yellow
But about tomorrow
But I’ve got the red pill
But I’m going to fly
But I'm not getting along
But I won't see you again
But I have no one around
But I gotta have you
But I don’t care
But I always loved you
Busted from all my dreams
Busted
Buses in the sky
Burning the house
Burning sun
Burning something cool
Burning midnight
Burning it all down
Burning inside
Burning in the night
Burning flesh from the saddle
Burning flames in the sky
Burning down the middle ground
Burner's ain't men
Burned rainbows
Burned in the ashes
Burned from the crown
Burn to ashes
Burn the papers
Burn the hole
Burn my mind
Burn my memory
Burn like a fluke
Burn her fire
Burn down doors
Burn again
Buried treasure
Buried somewhere else
Buried inside hell
Buried in the trees
Buried by a falling star
Bump my baby mouth
Bullying
Bully of civil liberty
Bullshit is just a weapon
Build me a bridge
Build a new life
Buckets full of wealth
Buck, beat your teeth
Brushing his teeth
Brought you on
Brought me all the stress
Brought in from the dead
Brought chaos
Brother
Broom together
Broken stetship
Broken souls
Broken relationship
Broken from orbit
Broken chords
Broken all the walls
Broken Heart
Broke the lock
Broke the door
Broke the bridge
Broke past you
Broke my heart
Broke in your jail
Broke glass in a jar
Broke all my dream
Brings tear apart my existence
Brings shame
Bringing the rain down
Bring your future before me
Bring your eyes close
Bring you your spirit
Bring them my love
Bring out the dustweavers
Bring my duties to you
Bring me through
Bring me out with you
Bring me notes
Bring me not so easily
Bring me freedom
Bring me down
Bring it for me
Bring it down
Bring home the star
Bring her down
Bring back watermelon
Bright fingers
Breathe quick
Breathe it out
Breaking your strength
Breaking your pride
Breaking in from nowhere
Break the rest of the world
Brash and insecure
Brand new singing
Brand new carpet
Brand new blood
Brain me hard
Bragging
Bound to nowhere
Bound to decay
Bound down and dead
Bound apart
Bouncing kite
Bounced in pain
Bought there in the deep blue
Bought me a lifetime
Bottle of soul
Both sides come together
Both on my high horse
Both of you
Borrows the lyrical rhythms
Born you’re lonely
Born without a word
Born to wander
Born to kill
Born to find
Born to do it
Born to be treated
Born strong
Born on this paper
Born on their nights
Born of a thousand bombs
Born in dreams
Born from the prison we broke
Born again
Boring and endless
Boogie man, what a mess
Bones sway
Bodies run high
Bodies of love
Blushing
Blue sky
Blue mountain way
Blue mist
Blue gills
Blue earth
Blue dresses
Blue and white
Blows your drink
Blows out
Blown away
Blowing us out
Blowing red to everyone
Blowing out my heart
Blowing in my mouth
Blow your dreams
Blow the whistle
Blow our minds
Blow my nose
Blow his head off
Blow for the grave
Blow by the sea
Blow around for fun
Bloodstains to our memory
Bloodstained angel hair
Bloodlines in my veins
Bloodlines
Bloodline is broken
Bloodletting
Blood-drenched things
Blood written like wax
Blood still breathing
Blood star
Blood row
Blood on the chalkboard
Blood moon
Blood is the light
Blood in veins
Blood for me
Blood drips down the street
Blood comes down in veins
Blood being poured down the streets
Blood and lava
Blood
Blocked their throats
Block
Bling my eyes
Bless the morning
Blaming your boss
Blame you
Blackbird blue
Black virgin, naked star
Black strap
Black slips and silver wires
Black porcelain and plumage
Black or white
Black hoodie
Black Dahlia
Bitter as ice
Bite the heartstrings
Bikes running on the ground
Big secret
Big picture
Big mistake
Big lovable face
Big bitch
Big and powerful
Beyond this poem
Beyond the street
Beyond the exile
Beyond on the daily stream
Beyond a thousand jagged walls
Beyond a shadow
Bewildered
Between us
Between the streets
Between the rock-solid blocks
Between running and sleep
Between my eyes
Better that you’re satisfied
Better than kings
Better terrify the breeze
Better play dead
Better off playing our game
Better hold your nose
Better hear me now
Betrayal a bad son
Betrayal
Best of all worlds
Beneath the crack of wind
Beneath the branches
Beneath everything
Bending the world
Believe you once and for all
Believe in one belief
Believe
Being a commodity
Behind you
Behind those asleep
Behind them
Behind the waves
Behind the pipe
Behind the long and soft glow
Behind the lights of your dreams
Behind the iron bars
Behind the curtain
Behind the camera
Behind him
Behind all the stars
Behind a black curtain
Begin to sleep
Begging for him
Begging for gold
Begging for blood
Begging
Before your statue
Before your hands glide
Before you were alive
Before you know it
Before we started
Before the wheels come off
Before that floor
Before he’s gone
Before he died
Been waiting for you I’m not satisfied
Been up all night
Been through their yarmulkes
Been taken by a spell
Been sick and tired of telling you
Been quiet since we met
Been looking for the time machine
Been crying and laughing in your head
Been awhile since you started
Been away for days
Been a long time ago
Becoming your own brother
Becoming a man
Becomes hot
Becomes all gone
Becomes a part of you
Because you’re sold
Because you’re my lover
Because of your glory
Because of you
Because I’m such a shame
Because I'm awake
Because I will be fine
Beautiful to watch
Beautiful to see
Beautiful and moving
Beat your wheel
Beat you up like a beast
Beat their minds from the inside
Beat a big time
Be too young
Be sure you’ve seen me
Be quiet and dream
Be prepared for the attack
Be like Mom on fire
Be in love
Be here in the house
Be gentle
Be free to ride
Be free
Be careful for the kings of emptiness
Be away from it all
Battle ready for the outside world
Battle on my mind
Battering glass
Bastard at all
Barely fitting my soul
Bam it sounds like a stretch
Bad to the soul
Bad luck
Bad falls in love
Bad brother
Bad ass over again
Bad as they were
Back when I was young
Back up to hide
Back to what I thought it meant
Back to the old ways
Back to square one
Back to some strange place
Back to sleep
Back to making the place my dream
Back on the run
Back of the tongue
Back my dreams
Back in the ways
Back in the shadows
Back in the game
Back in the day
Back home, there
Back for the night
Back again
Baby’s eyes are watering
Baby, slow the blood fly
Baby, it won't come again
Baby you’re at least kidding?
Baby your little tail
Baby wants to move out of me
Baby
Aye to hell
Awesome height and style
Awesome
Attracts your attention
Attracted to you by the noise
Attacking yourself
At this time I'll be alone
At the start
At the bottom of a noose
At the best job
At that time
At peace
At once confused and confused
At least now they do laugh
At last I got my chance
At home
At first, we need each other
At first
At all times
At a mealtime
Assemble the spark of a hurricane
Asphyxiating my dreams
Asleep’s ready to be asleep
Asleep in a chair
Asleep
Asking him to get home
Ask the others
Ask that boy why
Ask me, why I don’t go?
Ask me one question
Ask her, when?
Ask anybody
Ask a piece of your mind
Ashes my soul
Asap is a blessing
As you wake
As you sleep
As we were killing time
As we have died
As warm as you can touch
As they say, the shortening of memory
As the devil
As soon as my darling dream comes true
As soon as I hear you
As soon as I can feel her today
As soft as they can sing
As new as she appears
As near as you can get
As much pleasure as I can get
As long as I’ve been asleep
As long as I watch the country fall
As long as I stay
As it stands now
As it rains
As if they saw
As he closes his mouth
As good as these tits of yours
As for a voice that could rap
As cool as he was
As beautiful as your promises
As a reflection
As I was thinking
As I walk the highway
As I fell asleep
As I can only watch
Around the town
Around the clock
Are you with me?
Are you so cold?
Are you hurting me?
Are you here?
Are you going to fail me now?
Are you going to be ok?
Are you crazy?
Are you awake today?
Are you afraid?
Are we comfortable here?
Are the years of pursuit around you?
Are the pills faster than our eyes?
Arbours come all the way around
Anywho’s mind is mine
Anywhere you could go
Anyway you brought me here
Anyway to keep things a secret
Anyway
Anytime you put your hat on
Anything you need to do
Anything you might say
Anything you could say
Anything to help me get there
Anything that makes you want to scream
Anything goes
Anything for sale
Anything but trash
Anyone knows me
Anyhow
Anybody knows
Anybody follow me?
Anybody else?
Any, do you mean, anything?
Any life is a story
Any damn time will tell me so
Any clues you've found
Any chance you can get
Any chance I can get
Another years from now
Another year or two
Another way to end things
Another trick
Another time, another time
Another time
Another story
Another man on the bench
Another journey through the night
Another fan
Another down year
Another day with the crime
Another city to call
Another chain of censorship
Another battle
Another I’ll come home
Anger flows down my spine
Angel as glow in the moon
And you’ve never found the security
And you’ve got a question mark
And you’re watching
And you’re tired of it
And you’re the boss
And you’re so uptight
And you’re ours
And you’re keeping me high
And you’re alone
And you've never seen his worst?
And you're watching
And you're taking care of you?
And you want to kiss me
And you see a man
And you left
And you laugh
And you know it?
And you know
And you just want to wake
And you don’t take my word for it
And you can’t win
And you can hear it now
And you are satisfied
And yet you’re smiling
And yet I’m growing tired
And yet I know
And yes, I know
And with no holy flag
And who knew?
And when we reach for her
And what is darkness until the last scene
And what can I do?
And we’ll go as far as we can
And we're going home
And we knew
And we got to start laughing
And two laws
And today
And to no one in particular
And to live forever
And to be so naive
And thought he would keep a secret
And this time you are
And they tell me
And they go by
And they broke it down
And they believe
And there's nothing you can do
And there is truth in my heart
And then the silhouette
And then it’s back
And then it’s all over
And then it is gone
And then it hurts
And then he attacked
And then I was like, What are you doing?
And then I died
And the whole sky
And the soundtrack to gangsta rap
And the shells of times gone
And the room
And the future of my existence
And the fear’s gone
And the fear?
And the double life’s in conflict
And the darkness and winter
And the airlocks in the saddle
And that we all belong
And that darkness
And that I feel I am getting
And teach your children love
And still I’m human
And stay away
And soothes my heart
And someday you will
And some more than others
And so she let him down
And so I’ve got this squinted eye
And smoke stains your eyes
And smile like a girl
And smile again
And sit without love
And she wants to be there
And she saw the master once again
And she had to change places
And she came and danced
And set to dance
And see the great light
And say how men are nice
And said, it wouldn't hurt to be free
And rids the world of evil
And please mind your touch
And one of the seed holes
And one of my violent rules
And now you are
And now they broke away
And now the blood boiling
And now that she thinks I can see
And now it’s time to say goodbye
And now it’s over
And now come and go
And now I see
And now I feel something good
And no more lies
And my wicked tongue can sing
And my body is sinking
And listen
And let me know
And kiss and weave
And it’s wrong
And it’s no wonder
And it’s doing fine
And it went way too slow
And it got darker
And is it guilt you need?
And in this dream
And in the next revolution
And in the morning
And in my memory
And if you were
And if it all ends on the same day
And how cool it is
And he’s the king
And he’s bearing the bullshit
And he’ll try to dance
And he’ll be waiting
And here we come this morning
And here it is
And he makes mistakes
And half the door
And get inside your body
And forget about me
And for you
And every sound you made
And don’t give up
And didn't say I was sorry
And cuddle a deer
And come back the other way
And cold blood leads to poverty
And bring about violence
And because of the way you look?
And at what price
And ask me that
And as the sun shines
And all three of you die
And again
And I’ve no idea
And I’m up
And I’m sorry it felt so good
And I’m in love
And I’ll never stop
And I’ll have you know
And I’ll be fine
And I've got it in me
And I ’ve got no shame
And I wonder how
And I will die tomorrow
And I wasn't there at the wedding
And I wanted to tease you
And I think you’ve done
And I slept it up
And I shall win again
And I see you
And I see it clearly
And I made a mistake
And I know what they do
And I know this because I’ve got to it
And I know that
And I know it’s coming
And I find myself waiting
And I fell for you
And I feel nothing
And I don't know what
And I died this year
And I didn’t know
And I didn't know what I saw
And I
An untold story
An unspoken legacy
An order to you
An old friend
An incongruous destiny
An immortal flame
An ideal place to show the world
An hourglass I’m seen in the airport
An honest revelation
An exact duplicate
An eternity
An eternally cool morning
An entirely different animal
An enemy
An endless stream of love
An ending
An art in the kitchen
An anger-filled cave
An angel of God
An amazing smile
An Indian sorcerer
Amusing the imagination
Amongst the dead in solitude
Among your shattered teeth
Among the stars
America is a shark
Am I supposed to sound like a nightmare
Always-living everybody
Always sigh
Always satisfied
Always keep my little princess smiling
Always gonna be like you
Always changing
Always been that way
Always
Alright first time's the charm
Alone on our honeymoon
Alone in awe
Alone in a room
Alone in a corner
Alone
Aloha
Allow me to keep you waiting
All you’ll ever see
All your suits
All your scars
All your dreams do
All you people you knew
All you got to say
All you can do
All will be fine
All we've got to do
All we made was for you
All too strong
All times long
All through town
All through the night
All through eternity
All this time
All things you’ve seen
All they say
All these warnings
All these nightpaths
All these minutes of your time
All these lights parted
All the way through
All the waves I drag
All the things I used to do
All the stones follow you
All the speed making this show reel
All the rest are dead
All the praise
All the pictures
All the people’s dishes
All the new language
All the memories
All the losers
All the little angels in yellow
All the laws
All the houses in town
All the great things
All the girllike gems
All the evils
All the dead wings belong to her
All the children's songs
All the buildings fall down
All the better for it
All that stuff
All talk of flying
All signs are for a bad change
All right with you
All right now
All right
All power to the devil
All over your body
All over the whole city
All over the street
All over the city
All over
All our feelings
All of you falling apart
All of you
All of us getting fired
All of this is for me
All of them outside
All of them crying
All of my friends are singing
All of my free time
All night and day
All new toys
All my tears
All my hearts are in your pocket
All men will be sailors
All men seem to love
All men can do
All man-made crime
All love
All life is alright
All kinds of life trials
All in one neat lil' jet
All her illusions
All hell breaks loose
All day you go
All day long
All business
All around the world
All around the table
All around me
All around
All along the lines of life
All aboard my ship
All I've been was love
All I want to say is new stars
All I want to do is pretend
All I want is you
All I want is for you to die
All I need now
All I know
All I ever knew
All I can say
All I can do
All God wants me to be
Alive today
Alive just in the grip of madness
Albeit it's kinda funny
Aired on a mist
Ain’t nobody’s role
Ain’t like the world’s a city
Ain't there nothing wrong with me?
Ain't nobody doing it
Ain't gonna be unkind to you
Ain't all that matters
Ain't a city of pigs
Ah, from Beneath the Wall
Ah, and he’ll touch my heart
Against the wall
Against all odds
Afterward
After your death
After looking for this
After all the rain
After all she fought for
After all is said and done
Afraid you'll burn me
Afraid to lose their love
Afraid of light
Afraid I'm gonna cry
Adrift
Adorably close to nothing
Admit it began with you
Admired old swashbuckler
Addicted to pixie dust
Addicted to love
Add your clothes
Act of war
Act matter
Act like the newborn
Act at the same time
Across your bony skull
Across this hill
Across the water
Across the town
Across the sea
Across the ocean
Across the heavens
Across the corner
Across a river
Across a barren beat
Acrobat made me awake
Acorns for sung sirens
Accepting the things you're good at
Accept your place
Accept this favor
Accept this door
Accept and abandon
Absolutely true
Absolutely fucking killer
Absolutely fucked off
Absolutely
Above your hour
Above the times
Above the stations
Above my crescendo
Above every monster
Above a big cell
About wanting to kiss something
About the law
About my music
About lost years
About her
About fourteen or eighteen feet away
About equal time
About an hour ago
About all your awful doings
Abandoning everything
Abandoned, shell-shocked, searching
Abandoned pet
Aaaand all that wildness
A-going-down
A-changin' like all these people
A young, sharp-eyed boy
A young man just to give
A worthless rag
A wizard’s prison
A witness to my misery
A wine vase
A white chicken
A while ago you used to see me
A well-lit place
A weird crowd
A way of life
A wave of love
A warning tomorrow
A warm wall
A warm dream
A voice that will meet you
A voice inside my heart
A vision
A view of disappointment
A very stupefying time
A very minor obstacle
A vast tail of debt
A vase
A vacant part
A universal claim
A twenty-five hour rampage
A truer word
A trip to the seas
A tree I ride
A treasure that will come back
A train of fire
A toy
A torch is lit
A timeless defeat
A time to cross the line
A time for closing time
A tight green flag
A thousand years of land
A thousand ugly people
A thousand strange images
A thousand pages of a smooth head
A thousand nights in love
A thief's play
A tear in his eye
A sweet warm rainbow
A summerie doll
A sucker who knows nothing
A storm of emotion
A storm in the news
A statue made of myself
A star of Babylon
A squirrel only grows up
A sorrowful world
A song the insects of war
A song about greatness
A song
A snake of pride
A smiling baby
A smile opens my eyes
A smile on his face
A small rainbow
A sleaze
A skull in your hand
A sister dreamed
A single and innocent hero
A simple human death
A silver star
A sigh
A sickness of flesh
A shot through
A shield
A shadow of that youth
A sensitive song
A search for the spine
A sea wave
A screamer
A scene of fear
A scarlet mess
A scarlet kiss
A salute to the love-specialty
A sad time
A rose-tinted-glass
A room full of people
A rock star now
A rock at the side of the road
A riot with ghosts
A ring over your face
A rifle in your hand
A rich, noble face
A red flag you won't see
A real bandit boy
A rabbit?
A punchline
A punch in the arm
A proud rhyme
A promise of some value
A promise
A prize
A private place you see before
A princess shatters
A prince of sunshine
A position held dear to her heart
A policeman walkin' by at the tender age
A planewalk
A place without anything but books
A place where you love me
A place to rest
A place to hide
A place of amusement
A place in hell
A pint of hard liquor
A photo on the wall
A photo of little Lily
A part of you
A part of me
A pair of sunglasses
A pair of blonde ladies
A pain in the stomach
A pack in the air
A nine-year old living with demons
A nice job
A nice flower
A newborn son
A new world
A new way to say yes
A new kingdom
A new all-time high
A nation of slaves
A mysterious future
A mountain of dead apples
A motherfucking mess of me
A month separates us
A miracle
A million people
A million miles away
A midnight vision
A meteor ride
A message that appears in the blue skies
A mental question
A mellow voice
A mask
A man that can’t understand
A man of steel
A man of principles
A man can dance
A madman waiting for you
A loveable blonde boy
A lovable shit
A lost age
A loose stitch
A look back at my childhood
A lonely way
A lonely bag
A little under our wings
A little more earth is kept cold
A little boy gets their nights
A little blue hot
A little bit of romance
A line of flowers
A lighter no less
A light that is broken
A lifetime of loneliness
A life free of suffering
A lie
A letter from you
A lethal mist
A lawn is being cleaned
A large ball of fire
A lake of fire
A knot in my throat
A kite’s wings
A kiss in the desert
A kindred spirit
A kid walking around
A kid on my tomb
A key to getting things done
A key in your game
A key chord
A joke
A jet black stall
A hurricane's gonna catch up
A human made of spirit
A human hand
A highway under one foot
A heartbeat unravelling
A haunting look
A hatred so powerful
A hallucinatory notion
A habit to exist
A gun for your phone
A green beauty from cold
A good scene
A goal-maker
A glass of wine
A glass of red
A girl's voice
A girl full of silver
A girl and a girl
A girl I would never lose
A gilded story
A ghost town
A gentle wind
A garden cut leaves a dead star
A game of mirrors
A game changer
A funeral for him
A friend of mine’s death
A friend died
A flying tram
A fly in the night
A fleeting scene
A flaming shark
A firework structure
A fine trinity
A fine instrument
A fine hill
A fine dress
A fight between opposites
A feeling that this was gonna last
A feeling I can feel
A feather in a jar
A dying star
A dying soul
A drug-crazed rage
A drug addict kid
A drowsy little boy's job
A dream of serenity
A doorbell rings
A divine personality
A different ending
A difference between rose
A desperate dream
A demure and sweet feeling
A dark heart
A crown
A crowd
A crime against good law
A couple days ago
A corner of the room
A constant stream of lies
A colourless idol
A collection of bad deeds
A clue
A club
A cloud in the sky
A clattering dance
A city town
A city on the brink
A chord that crosses a bridge
A cage window
A butterfly in your hand
A butterfly
A busy time
A bunch of old songs
A brother room
A brighter future
A bride, a shining love
A breeze now blows
A brave, jealous, violent blind angel
A bowl of flesh to eat
A book of my soul
A bird of terror
A big smile
A big old, hardhat river
A big jam
A big china shelf
A beautiful view
A beautiful red earth
A beautiful painting
A beautiful night
A bank vault of all his friends
A balance
A bad kiss
A baby face
A baby born all alone
